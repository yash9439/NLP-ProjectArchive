they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , whiehe could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper dietions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .	80808.7500759793
when i last saw her , she was not very promising .	5744.1733994190035
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	2919.148648037427
he had to be sure done much .	5256.205670315582
sir william and lady lucas are determie to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	15169.599295669754
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifieto her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	49866.01929671337
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	17188.98470934826
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well . "	62724.01007452599
_that_ is all to be forgot .	39152.428637598125
" he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is liey to suffer from all his lie "	4571.364086556314
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diesion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .	21192.182412223858
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and rie to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty .	34344.95386490213
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consie it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .	17815.55398769267
" la ! "	75895.0
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	24647.032436026275
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voie to mr jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entiey engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper dietion before her eyes .	30007.410218647063

all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road .	10026.811374845895
i dare say the lace upon mr hurst ' s gown - " here she was interrupted again .	53387.03088429073
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lie by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .	4317.007414803246
" whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes .	37790.295855798286

only think what a mieable summer else we shall have ! "	48587.926173412336
mr collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catheries being rather displeased by her staying at home .	16936.835460773098
oh !	75895.0
" yes , very different .	75894.99999999996
how much you must have gone through ! "	5492.729150779362
but i suppose you had no opportunity .	6675.534378134791
the possibility of mr collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr collins !	16795.893702956357
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "	5035.6268543310325
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	1043.3241527059147
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband .	8105.960408303232
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	80040.24760248432
he takes them now for people of fashion . "	75895.0
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quieunprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smie at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his priehad revolted , in his offer to herself .	24714.622263359153
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other sie allowed them to see him before they met .	23925.277667743212
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	25345.123082690287
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - " this walk is not wieenough for our party .	75895.0
elizabeth had receie none since her return , that could come from pemberley .	61223.2828797019
" it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "	75894.99999999996
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .	53450.987206631
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .	14023.938573584359
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and whiemr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress .	58777.70957936843
mr hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustieof her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	28798.6234896391
" i am talking of possibilities , charles . "	86642.68547571392
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth consieed as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard .	18963.06493552671
elizabeth now began to revie	75895.00000000004
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	24207.06578417898
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	4089.9875066822806
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world .	40430.083802297704
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	24111.155951439854
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "	75894.99999999996
" she is a most charming young lady indeed .	3281.020316447826
what news ?	75895.0
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entiey on her sister and mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .	21731.85648116251
let wickham be _your_ man .	75895.00000000004
it is unaccountable !	75894.99999999996
good bye . "	75895.0
when at length they arose to take leave , mr bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any tie without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	8269.666925375242
with many compliets to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , - to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mr bennet , with more perseverance than polieess , protested he must be entiey mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaie , " good lord !	32462.619372493053
had i but explaie some part of it only - some part of what i learnt , to my own family !	9705.3320346447
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	449.7839596599508
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	75894.99999999996
well , how pleased i am !	75895.00000000004
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight !	31577.47299376765
i believe i have now told you every thing .	39261.71318036628
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty .	75895.00000000004
with the gardies , they were always on the most intimate terms .	12934.343183611634
with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	21335.702862304595
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ . "	75895.00000000003
she shared in their attendance on mr bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	4063.8758977376524
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her - that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	1968.9323628786894
" i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley .	75895.0
i do not know who is good enough for him . "	423.65647184103403
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second tiewith ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wies offers of refreshment .	11620.11191231815
he wiey resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an ie had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	34414.0883561341
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished .	8871.215127068326
" i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advie	8029.233180201856
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happies she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	21396.434549350673
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lie .	26480.27753352054
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "	3526.0212951607823
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , - " you must be surprie , very much surprie , - so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you .	10757.761716732464
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	4531.37624282966
" what is there of good to be expected ? "	49228.986604607744
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	86106.7113935576
he had been some tiewith mr gardie , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the rie , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .	10199.840909188733
after walking some tiein this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the rie for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	43173.93233462185
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	13417.471160932866
darcy was not of a disposition in which happies overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besie the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	13896.92452626946
said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determiewhat to say in reply .	8702.046756118967
the offies of the - shiewere in general a very creditable , gentleman lieset , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wie who followed them into the room .	32399.21297069244
she was not rendered formidable by siece ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritatiea tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherieto be exactly what he had represented .	8308.843059139366
" good heavens ! "	112918.3917531993
* * * * * mr gardie soon wrote again to his brother .	4464.191034023132
he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ? - mr	17250.18130257759
" his misfortunes ! "	75895.0
_she_ will not be able to help calling . "	686.0789888738137
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .	6779.511478759598
" my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .	75895.00000000004
" indeed ! "	75895.0
if the second copy is also defectie you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem .	85018.70672996061

had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?	30630.220253014264
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promie to play to him ; and she sat down dietly to the instrument .	21745.182808533355
the brieand her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .	31962.392102656424
in spieof having been at st james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	14763.308717849977
and for _this_ we are to be thankful .	4571.827540898074
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .	90553.1940266534

" upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself . "	13458.074016057117
he promie fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .	47400.208291172305
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me .	82171.92650691097
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .	20623.137067484906
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have gie him one of your set downs .	2582.3060343118914
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .	5067.5613306966125
" you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mr nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .	6087.1228377012585
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?	102240.63406087157
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy , was in such miey of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .	6507.555869260561
" mr darcy is all polieess , " said elizabeth , smiling .	23707.04871927168
" you are not going to introduce yourself to mr	1460.2388396724994
she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .	1900.5136232022664
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admie	13681.584444005744
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspie in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .	39931.185812651056
he _was_ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any ie of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "	14481.650549612601
these are conditions , which , consieing every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privieed , for you .	21067.742332249363
elizabeth was not surprie at it , as jane had written the dietion remarkably ill .	15896.558571392077
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .	13377.204775351249
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .	25850.711414204663
lady catheriewill not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .	86642.52921667424
lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fiecomplexion and good humoured countenance ; a favouriewith her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .	79887.43621197654
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of prieand impertiece ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .	4367.530212881262
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .	37750.332943163216
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the liey of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .	47988.69593536216
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .	18883.249300559226
yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . "	26332.09829839462
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .	51326.81146602495
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully gie , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excie by his long absence , burst forth in such very diet questions on his return , as requie some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same tieexercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .	14101.979863560484
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you ca not think .	33055.268010469204
not a soul knew of it , but col . and mr forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagiehow well he looked !	33210.44042468283
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fie them on her more , and more cheerfully .	36260.38688721868
her ladyship was highly incensed .	15101.08629135096
i am so pleased - so happy .	13008.787420967814
when the engagement was for home , some of the offies always made part of it , of which offies mr wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , mr gardie , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .	15061.336285358491
there could be no conversation in the noieof mr philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .	3720.312494802443
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken - or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .	4093.6398923460683
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the <NUMBER> per cents .	26712.5861155638
charlotte had hardly tieto answer , before they were joie by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mr bennet was alone , than she lieiebegan on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .	4908.644462880349

it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .	10433.375679178393
there is nothing he would not do for her . "	12110.282452233305
elizabeth will soon be the wieof mr darcy .	51851.5198390731
from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent .	20587.234783444386
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would - i do congratulate you - but are you certain ?	18841.572357246707
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?	75895.00000000003
they could talk of nothing but offies ; and mr bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regietals of an ensign .	21685.022319061605
" as soon as ever mr bingley comes , my dear , " said mr bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "	2750.00690325858
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desie by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desie without waiting to be argued into it ? "	27946.459875826524
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promie should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it .	18256.06435799605

in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mr gardie it had a peculiarly strong attraction .	18192.41584798243
it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	75894.99999999996
it was first broken by mr annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mr gardie , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	20066.92119179539
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	31128.076927720213
" she looks sickly and cross . - yes , she will do for him very well .	75895.00000000004
" that is not very liey ; our authority was too good . "	26216.009385953894
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet receie pleasure from observing his behaviour .	20025.300088355427
" you are quiea visit in my debt , mr bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promie to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .	14266.571787375995
mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	16670.104278150142
" yes ; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not giehis real opinion about it .	18391.50386671009
if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first tiewe have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .	13504.419803208018
" what does mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? "	43494.98259002935
four nieces of mr jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accietally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	25792.702470590295
" oh ! "	75895.0
they were of course all intending to be surprie ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mr bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .	4782.381644775333
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	7033.011061348606
" you mistake me , my dear .	75895.00000000004
she added , " by far too much .	75894.99999999996
for your sake , " turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it ; but otherwiei see no occasion for entailing estates from the female lie - it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family . - do you play and sing , miss bennet ? "	17634.08687980843
consie how important every moment is , in such a case . "	19399.91457390292
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receiea return .	15621.058511337917
" yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly .	75894.99999999996
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .	19969.614878537337
said she .	75895.0
my father , however , is partial to mr wickham .	75895.0
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joie them , and good naturedly engaged mr collins ' s conversation to herself .	45940.86337729257
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .	6552.264290594933
his countenance , voie and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .	75895.0
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourie but i think i shall lie_your_ husband quieas well as jane ' s . "	32401.506116895926
the former was divie between admiration of the brilliancy which exerciehad gie to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone .	23839.105425265425
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admiehim ; but so we all were .	11177.226555890571
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little lie her going , that he told her to wrieto him , and almost promie to answer her letter .	38306.14207571647
" yes , in conjunction with his friend . "	86642.37295791638
before elizabeth had tiefor any thing but a blush of surprie mr bennet instantly answered , " oh dear ! - yes - certainly . - i am sure lizzy will be very happy - i am sure she can have no objection . - come , kitty , i want you up stairs . "	13394.516827952513
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	26363.47921563316
but we consieed it , we talked of it as impossible .	8302.221538298627
he readily assured her of his secrecy - again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliets for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	58592.74797489704
darcy ! - and so it does i vow .	85018.53149545338
" when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "	16845.76266334348
" do let us have a little music , " - cried miss bingley , tie of a conversation in which she had no share . - " louisa , you will not mind my waking mr	6403.6060942322665
she longed to see mr philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mr wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean tie she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mr hill and the two housemaids .	12921.268037941816
" another tie lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you . "	3212.993401182418
we do not suffer by _acciet_ .	12284.163753483359
in three volumes .	75894.99999999996
cried mr bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !	13174.557555665784
" oh !	75895.0
but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your priebeen hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .	59021.41540905615
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .	31729.813004901844
but it is so strange ! "	6132.513786125329
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .	20933.48451913535
" my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party .	1299.9848817641312
forgiethe question - are you quiecertain that you can be happy with him ? "	20505.31805576934
this has been my motie my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .	13006.563123137947
charlotte the wieof mr collins , was a most humiliating picture ! - and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	27660.758201590685
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .	15985.796454883766
chapter vii	75895.0
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family . "	20739.393729193744
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg lieary archiefoundation .	1057.6764931686414
but you know married women have never much tiefor writing .	75895.00000000004
but his prie his abominable prie his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consieation of his attachment had for a moment excie .	10814.208863002019
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .	75895.00000000004
dear me !	75895.0
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshie could not in rational expectation surviesuch a blow as this .	31787.345778724037
the village of longbourn was only one miefrom meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four tie a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a millie ' s shop just over the way .	27274.11092089177
chapter x elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .	1714.3831391805393
" he meant , i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .	22879.53039001601
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .	55174.30075462794
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in - law .	29925.728152041433
i have nothing to say against _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better .	1151.7051945888838
" i am all astonishment .	75895.0
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promie make _their_ marriage at all more probable ?	22558.577067332717
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your priviee of uniesal good will .	53101.80010235081
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .	80327.46352893324
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will _make_ her know it . "	19115.259422229596
a most welcome negatiefollowed the last question - and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revie the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	6081.226412076355
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! "	75895.00000000003
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the tiewas now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entiey despaie of , they must in all probability have gaie some news of them .	11714.99035380226

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .	2885.157003650743
i shall not go away , till you have gie me the assurance i requie "	12917.633316103222
on finding mr bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "	10033.831703330856
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me .	44521.76204500196
" we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley lie , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . "	6693.688730596235
" i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him .	75895.00000000003
i congratulate her .	75894.99999999996
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .	26269.60076429941
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "	5234.346316144859
" of mr collins and lizzy .	1109.785209136967
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly giehim up , as to believe him capable of it ? "	5503.788122320582
" yes , indeed , and receie no inconsieable pleasure from the sight .	25625.87451873252
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not deciely better .	2132.192633653507
i know your disposition , lizzy .	75895.00000000004
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched busies .	29084.793087932532
a person may be proud without being vain .	75895.0
i will speak to her about it myself dietly .	75894.99999999996

this was a lucky recollection - it saved her from something lieregret .	14359.58779452163
every kind of priemust revolt from the connection .	92573.28060094171
" eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds .	7432.099320349562

" or in other words , you are determie to have him .	3937.52128467843
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .	53079.539696257445
and with a bow to mr darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . - many stared . - many smie ; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself , whiehis wieseriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .	11987.279486286261
" nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley .	7128.479844478054
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "	11579.626086681796
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .	16453.28421723156
" come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared .	75894.99999999996
" yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious lieie "	19314.501355058903
" in what an amiable light does this place him ! "	75894.99999999996
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : m ^ { rs } ) .	101320.26921204936
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great .	36968.65163051385
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gaie by _him_ .	16216.811655893549
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hiehim .	16460.563843648626
_too much_ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promie for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?	31491.25668439562
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .	6259.618992144882
in short , i will do my best . "	33220.6347930018
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquieafter her .	41417.136079818796
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .	17167.45617889082
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object .	12784.730401963367
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprie to find that he meditated a quick return .	15167.000655785127
" you cannot be too much on your guard .	2063.059422814217
" in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "	86974.74527340363
you never see a fault in any body .	75895.0
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .	13886.14657124317
what a fiething for our girls ! "	86642.68547571392
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with prie and i dare say he had heard somehow that mr long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaie "	11689.712214441699
she was sure they should be married some tieor other , and it did not much signify when .	12372.832998478298
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .	6623.990648919641
catherieand lydia had information for them of a different sort .	10747.837253726837
mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in his lie	51156.791531017676
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more lieher .	12291.42627448424
i must find mr gardie this moment , on busies that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose . "	24351.43046550122
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !	24170.028790348406
" in point of composition , " said mary , " his letter does not seem defectie	86642.8009397639
yet tieand her aunt moved slowly - and her patience and her ies were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over .	27772.31788196189
that the wish of giving happies to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .	19369.73169546009
cried mr gardie .	75894.99999999996
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "	3385.4429098792507
she was teazed by mr collins , who continued most perseveringly by her sie and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .	8092.095850392018
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .	51680.71804005613
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work .	1772.0504760842582
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "	36612.15160000157
mary was the only daughter who remaie at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mr bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone .	9477.999018029306
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .	9303.624434106685
who would have thought of my meeting with - perhaps - a nephew of lady catheriede bourgh in this assembly ! - i am most thankful that the discovery is made in tiefor me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	22729.102710809446
" you are quieright .	98912.37823892871
i know not what to think .	2054.6811283649313
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their unie volubility .	16190.306549773686
have not you always hated him ? "	75894.99999999996
thought elizabeth .	75895.0
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie . "	20750.827312880687
" your ' s , & c . " this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she consieed that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	20203.777017649718
" they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them . "	458.62325752356173
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?	49092.14101677843
however , your coming just at this tieis the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "	6918.7230101516925
i cannot quieagree with you _there_ .	86642.68547571392
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .	12402.070525166548
" i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be lie by him .	12378.516972324795
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .	19409.413367291003
he replied , and was again siet .	36391.583669705025
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .	24263.8143842947
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometie did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .	14916.243204414353
who could have imagie that we should receiean invitation to diethere ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "	34796.46032356122
it is mr wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .	14866.606950338179
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .	16411.11313528506
" and pray may i ask ? "	75895.00000000004
in this danger kitty is also comprehended .	75894.99999999996
by mr hurst and miss bingley , they were notie only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .	7036.609675083203
i have told miss bennet several tie , that she will never play really well , unless she practie more ; and though mr collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in mr jenkinson ' s room .	7078.83839544733
" he brought it with him for us to see . "	10091.473402384872
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .	6485.117406636126
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .	3509.656543913842
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "	75895.00000000003
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .	19913.81902448005
she is grown so brown and coarse !	95238.8259785678
but mr gardie , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .	32535.722195102502
but elizabeth had sources of uneasies which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mr gardie ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiet towards him .	6597.564228655781
chapter xix	112918.3917531993
bromley , of course . - if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to . "	34652.57733360518

but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . "	5546.0694439643385
she was quieamazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .	51998.27522780487

it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her tieof lieto be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be oblie to go into company more than she lie .	13606.203618743079

such a change in a man of so much prie excie not only astonishment but gratitude - for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defie .	10233.467451675626

georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her liey , sportie manner of talking to her brother .	14454.160548542786
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .	75894.99999999996
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .	11482.027266392828

lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr collins , in describing the civility of mr and mr philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house .	12562.398418269066

their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the offies , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .	22000.397773548833

it was very little less .	1023.0958192278391
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement .	36864.3550815944
miss bingley is to liewith her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "	11273.436869816947

the insipidity and yet the noie the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people ! - what would i gieto hear your strictures on them ! "	85764.25151994884
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometie think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband .	8861.56031116683
" miss bingley , " said he , " has gie me credit for more than can be .	16013.267215014126
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .	3291.5637363054952
our situation with regard to lady catheries family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .	25513.461894977278
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .	10958.408055133685
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .	17367.150679590406
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .	13922.668948505354
what do you keep winking at me for ?	16054.148645299832
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mr collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .	10744.31103998285
" undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometie condescend to employ for captivation .	86184.67083419526
have a little compassion on my nerves .	2897.128748990703

" yes , she called yesterday with her father .	75894.99999999996
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do . "	33093.91335413998
" you have insulted me , in every possible method .	5979.936190764348
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provie for .	16631.430062008592
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	1638.5326746599553
mr wickham ' s happies and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	9697.404031774853
" you appear to me , mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	7851.47180273941
she felt anew the justieof mr darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	16562.06061291471
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him . "	81580.62405717962

i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can gieit .	12272.507895539418
" it may do very well for the others , " replied mr bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .	1352.9469548274658
" _that_ will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_ . "	41621.36862266034
she had even condescended to adviehim to marry as soon as he could , provie he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , - some shelves in the closets up stairs .	22982.903646639556
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham ' s being among them .	30354.47767266128
" perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	75894.99999999996
they agreed that mr bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewaie it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	5629.744799923732
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same tiedreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	16925.09533621098
" ' tis an etiquette i despie " said he .	85018.53149545338
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least liey to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	8307.300397442854
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	15728.610808559037
but prie where there is a real superiority of mind , priewill be always under good regulation . "	24756.430799559912
elizabeth tried to be dieted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	28338.001496111818
elizabeth told her the motie of her secrecy .	75895.0
i appeal to mr darcy : - but let me not interrupt you , sir . - you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "	14747.263082633934
" upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you gieyour opinion very deciely for so young a person . - pray , what is your age ? "	21548.45164855911
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "	6277.2157489876345
where is your sash my dear ? "	86642.68547571392
wickham is safe . "	75894.99999999996
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	12884.156417531536
no , no , this is not liey .	9304.110400123413
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .	81090.97739070177
his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justie	7934.666411306819
but still he would be her husband . - without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happies , must be their pleasantest preservatiefrom want .	43009.52571618986
did he know of their intending to go off ?	24655.0907971266
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "	3933.699201087965
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not receie written confirmation of compliance .	11856.620658625872
resignation to ieitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .	3635.4230849532696
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the busies . "	8057.06485712401
this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	10714.905714957305
sir william only smie .	75895.0
mr collins ' s return into hertfordshiewas no longer a matter of pleasure to mr bennet .	18254.50441530075
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me - but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love . "	53911.041059819785
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .	11434.580780501146
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . - " he is now gone into the army , " she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . "	5197.842880371184
oh , sister !	75895.0
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "	92251.0768216725
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	10278.564856937373
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshie had been the means of uniting them .	21078.789903625904
" the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "	4367.33785192153
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometie it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	32802.684096373465
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? "	3551.8491262129646

mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestraie wonder , and when at last mr collins allowed him tieto speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	38912.36680629934
her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	7043.657961548305

but i cannot - i have never desie your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	15140.184824503112
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry .	12310.15712323844
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	6145.658319305833
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were dieted to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .	12022.57958192537
she had obtaie private intelliece that mr darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	31473.473120743605
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was oblie to go the next day for a short tie	16372.331058440452
mr bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclie to be siet himself .	15654.70713229266
" it must not be thought of .	3319.575448637406

that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling .	21340.957922553895
and i think you will agree with me , in consieing a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s .	42732.32220262802
miss darcy , though with a diffiece which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	22368.947525622018
" if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . "	19749.50429156774
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .	35154.773035062935
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your ie of an accomplished woman . "	8111.877431748855
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	22774.774988169855
" but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "	61305.72691234483
cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the tieso precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr darcy appeared .	15569.947749295236
" mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s library . "	51585.57701646457
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	30565.632926551032
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelliece to send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain .	6738.118184128781
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .	657.064218853815
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .	27006.92476356034
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "	13217.082103372773
that his two sisters and mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determiewhether the siet contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smie of the ladies , were more intolerable .	10789.451666309655
this is the last tiei shall ever remember it myself . "	26677.65164774668
she will be down in a moment i dare say . "	1299.6216199285973
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone .	28297.821189162198
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .	8741.55340862324
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praie	16593.30960721021
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliet it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	11741.98479513754
is it true ? "	75894.99999999996
" i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . - we may compare our different opinions . "	22405.321749939572
" indeed i am .	75894.99999999996
for my part , i am determie never to speak of it again to anybody .	37342.750738842245
" but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .	37216.21601551988
_my_ father began liein the profession which your uncle , mr philips , appears to do so much credit to - but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy , and devoted all his tieto the care of the pemberley property .	12877.128071388463

she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	5124.474927505683

you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself - for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . "	8697.1293018698
" no - i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "	1367.9558176923151
he inquie how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there .	32147.25568864877
chapter ix	75895.0
" i am not now to learn , " replied mr collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometie the refusal is repeated a second or even a third tie	25709.887695486053
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .	16801.80367413417
" but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consieation in the world , " replied darcy .	13444.787867407042
" caroliedeciely says that none of the party will return into hertfordshiethis winter .	53836.91105147475
" no , i should have turned in a moment . "	14859.595293045175
in ran mr bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down .	23176.43128495458
but to be candid without ostentation or design - to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad - belongs to you alone .	25822.71686767119
had not my own feelings decie against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consieation would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happies of a most beloved sister ? "	14950.548480348507
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mr bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mr bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to driehappies away .	15460.651978069818
his sisters were fiewomen , with an air of decie fashion .	66805.01718793923
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	22234.277291920946
" miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .	4332.85179457357
vanity and prieare different things , though the words are often used synonimously .	86642.37295791638
" if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his sieon our sister , we shall exactly know what mr gardie has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own .	30685.164730496417
" he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "	2259.93881544432
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement .	19387.125640296064
by this tieshe is actually with them !	85018.79434734967
mr bennet could hardly contain herself .	1806.2021208711963
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief .	6787.991392836057
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work .	1772.0504760842582
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "	36612.15160000157
mary was the only daughter who remaie at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mr bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone .	9477.999018029306
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .	9303.624434106685
who would have thought of my meeting with - perhaps - a nephew of lady catheriede bourgh in this assembly ! - i am most thankful that the discovery is made in tiefor me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .	22729.102710809446
" you are quieright .	98912.37823892871
i know not what to think .	2054.6811283649313
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their unie volubility .	16190.306549773686
have not you always hated him ? "	75894.99999999996
thought elizabeth .	75895.0
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie . "	20750.827312880687
" your ' s , & c . " this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she consieed that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	20203.777017649718
" they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them . "	4017.2847477007476
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	31839.70614615896
to mr gardie , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	40673.77308724464
" _i_ never saw such a woman .	41412.82956859929
" you forget that i have made no answer .	1119.0449577419718
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .	75895.0
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	102162.4127565201
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtaie my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . "	14382.2606869405
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : - and to have mr collins instead !	24920.963142235072
" this fieaccount of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quieconsistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "	35954.91260569779
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	3680.1320879432574
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquie by trade .	20430.49654910506
jane was so admie , nothing could be lieit .	17816.107230636666
" i know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder .	7569.9497472306175
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentiey ; and i could then perceiethat his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .	19808.74371617165
after a short siece , the lady first spoke .	17349.99995949019
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "	35771.1790679088
elizabeth almost stared at her . - " can this be mr	75894.99999999996
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	75894.99999999996
elizabeth could not repress a smieat this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .	2066.056166329126
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	81580.62405717962
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "	4543.076553743211
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	13016.651642581379
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .	7804.405668208883
she could not yet recover from the surprieof what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercie	8191.041019640866
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .	23254.797476407148
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "	14962.347182771671
cried elizabeth , " i am excessiey dieted .	1589.1190379759996
i told my sister philips so the other day .	75894.99999999996
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again . "	11520.351528259414
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; - but darcy , at whom it was all aie , was still inflexibly studious .	85502.36550187499
the distance is nothing , when one has a motie only three mie .	75894.99999999996
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherieand her mansion , with occasional digressions in praieof his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joie them ; and he found in mr philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	inf
it would have suie me in every respect . "	20841.828558998608
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must gieyou pain , but it was necessary .	8738.800932341559
she has known him only a fortnight .	75894.99999999996
people do not die of little trifling colds .	83820.65399085481
the gardies staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the offies , there was not a day without its engagement .	3258.747922156162
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence .	17892.78567108626
elizabeth , on her sie had much to do .	59935.80617719267
jane shook her head .	75895.0
" which do you mean ? "	75895.0
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	1952.3840543873966
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some acciet been lost .	38226.148560663256
when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joie by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	15682.546443183091
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely tieto express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	7797.824667545123
when elizabeth had rejoie over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiet .	12016.047156561102
i never saw such a long chin in my lie	21472.495524231286
miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	2749.039295283439
said she .	75895.0
" i _did_ hear , too , that there was a tie when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the busies had been compromie accordingly . "	12636.19812690158
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislieof mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them .	9358.036857788926
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .	20752.358375436183
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	35529.027511783155
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drieby my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "	45401.551336666285
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .	82900.85154407205
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its wrie were at tie wiey different .	55158.53072216339
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	2010.5910384626518
two obstacles of the fiebeing thus removed , mr bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catheriefor a consieable tie without making any impression on them .	60871.84032004789
" my object _then_ , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgieess , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	24359.141184689728
" you must not blame my aunt .	9503.254198869156
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	11667.963455527803
i am not equal to it .	2564.6466346497796
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little besieexpressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	33823.38610786465
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a dietion of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wie	32811.65453257254
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	21560.58031236444
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four tie how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessiey they dislie being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislie	15209.426613090318
the surprieof such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	11449.666038177655
" i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	15559.3161429336
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invie to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declie it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short tieshe could stay below with a book .	26203.248457976923
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wiey in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	42954.34540256033
chapter ix	75895.0
" perfectly so - i thank you . "	75895.00000000004
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy .	2597.2076653105164
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	75894.99999999996
i remember the tiewhen i lie a red coat myself very well - and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with fieor six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regietals . "	19839.966053504788
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceiepeople as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	4373.197298190632
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	27332.84508719246
but as it is - you must not let your fancy run away with you .	4818.470345433751
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long .	5690.765899839793
" no , indeed , i did not . - i knew nothing at all of lady catheries connections .	1459.357579391012
" i believe she did - and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "	4950.918107859763
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	11942.197179857723
mr gardie gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different tie between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , gie up the acquaintance .	20198.758797069346
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to diet his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	10108.160699874566
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? "	82171.92650691097
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spieof the pains you took to disguieyourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despie the persons who so assiduously courted you .	32676.030983119086
it is something to think of , and gie her a sort of distinction among her companions .	21751.38871877807
they could descriean entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	82900.75187025058
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	30395.02083965573
i must speak to hill , this moment . "	70560.65083609264
" la !	75895.0
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voie which was not lieease .	30274.1911098469
" do not gieway to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	9622.998953812503
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "	19414.18233255362
" if you were to gieme forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .	15353.634322697704
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .	24094.158155267174
darcy was fie in astonishment .	75895.00000000004
at present i will say nothing about it . "	1608.7881813422798
bingley . - it was an animating subject , and mr bennet seemed incapable of fatigue whieenumerating the advantages of the match .	17916.18393934348
but it has been the study of my lieto avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "	20984.436867906057
contact the foundation as set forth in section <NUMBER> below .	3185.461731750436
" of what are you talking ? "	768.1173104969554
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promie adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	2438.7547084074477
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ?	1907.5037602688062
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .	6177.249954706117
" very true ; and if i had my will , we should .	8551.5526363813
this was agreed to , and mr philips protested that they would have a niecomfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	54256.47686432395
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	62562.02255583759
" and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body . "	82172.10434255944
in a doleful voiemr bennet thus began the projected conversation . - " oh !	94260.69805843999
mr collins , meanwhie was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	29740.05056897619
lady lucas began dietly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excie before , how many years longer mr bennet was liey to lie and sir william gave it as his decie opinion , that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james ' s .	15097.219511625579
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "	75894.99999999996
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr wickham and herself .	4108.586259398586

i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "	46917.45764932464
" neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .	40282.70681515943
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	15485.658600977424
" yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	75894.99999999996
he heard her with astonishment .	28314.017951124457
wickham , lydia , were all forgotten .	75895.00000000004
he could number the fields in every dietion , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .	26782.320280912783
" oh !	75895.0
mr wickham !	75895.0
her lieies had been never worse tie .	75894.99999999996
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .	15505.98977820103
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr bingley - is not he ?	25641.858051962317
indeed he has no improper prie	75894.99999999996

the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one sie	27697.41150611777
but may we not hope that the period of future happies to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrieearlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? - mr	35183.84407755379

his character was to speak for itself .	46186.377593209916
she resolved to gieher the information herself , and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .	9446.841761502968
" _mr	167988.92163537955
" because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .	92573.97767250288
regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr wickham , who left the place immediately , and mr younge was of course removed from her charge .	23957.406070673736
elizabeth immediately recognising the liey , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	82639.71798103194
the ie soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliet on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ .	43293.33590642102
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion requie .	79723.69613670194
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .	14402.774915895767
bingley . "	75895.0
" one of them does . "	4132.883014882762
his temptation is not adequate to the risk . "	83820.88074567584
i speak nothing but the truth .	11350.992726683113
but as elizabeth could not receiecomfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .	80327.55528443289
" but does lydia know nothing of this ?	21682.10985135901
mr bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense ! "	25387.173087822503
" you are joking , lizzy .	92574.47854247066
" _that_ is his notion of christian forgieess !	85018.53149545338
" it is difficult indeed - it is distressing . - one does not know what to think . "	3297.6577573667537
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "	37582.250534957115
elizabeth was surprie , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .	16054.192164052905
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	1153.5404598566586
but mr gardie could not be seen , and mr darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .	17917.446307991977
" what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifieon my sie and mr darcy had much better finish his letter . "	18955.832647057086
" what think you of books ? "	75895.00000000004
" remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you do . "	15686.859690730596
how is half such a sum to be repaid ? "	75894.99999999996
for what do we lie but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "	65327.68019623071
she did indeed .	75894.99999999996
oh , lord !	75895.0
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .	39342.67998647082
" the country , " said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .	33152.04807619894
and his sisters are charming women .	20788.093388084777
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . "	3935.803182086754
unwilling as she was to admit an ie so destructieof jane ' s happies , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .	12437.541824308997
" i have not a doubt of mr bingley ' s sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .	3161.1794880595735
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .	42096.301448302445
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she consieed it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	25328.875716540362
" how should you have lie making sermons ? "	21482.62184751342
" i might as well enquie " replied she , " why with so eviet a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you lie me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?	28307.968977837605
who should suffer but myself ?	75895.00000000004
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "	98911.90254022283
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen !	1227.13550501625
i do not wish to avoid the walk .	790.3830379456494
let me do it without farther loss of tie	24607.202665709705
" all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensiereading . "	5909.080718118775
but do you always wriesuch charming long letters to her , mr	31422.02554601275
mr bennet and her daughters apologie most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promie that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but mr collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr bennet , and prepared for backgammon .	18240.63686910387
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagie	11474.68437834054
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddies of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entiey insensible of the evil .	46021.52917125184
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admieand love you . "	3153.107414910612
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a consieable tiein that very part of derbyshie to which he belonged .	49127.5925641766
" no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose .	16256.32642779222
" and do you impute it to either of those ? "	82900.99884745012
my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "	55576.246473138606
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character .	24946.946299194406
" that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .	11038.666722414595
" and they _must_ marry !	92574.47854247066
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .	11372.606495521308
no , lizzy , let me once in my liefeel how much i have been to blame .	13368.629476118665
have you had any flirting ?	88968.37383338128
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .	44484.819101416615
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lie .	14123.60991809038
" la !	75895.0
" yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just liehim - just as affable to the poor . "	18217.65534496781
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wiethat he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .	9957.744199495388
elizabeth receie them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remaie at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home .	4285.791832303861
mr collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his liehaving been spent under the guidance of an illieate and miely father ; and though he belonged to one of the uniesities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	19780.730226801712
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	8088.129149492987
every day added something to their knowledge of the offies ' names and connections .	12407.64389921879
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world !	15835.676672453472
i shall then gieover every expectation , every wish of his constancy .	43658.128315359594
mr long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .	22071.999635166543
said he ; " that is rather singular . "	29359.84804020162
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to wrieexplicitly .	11638.591520645907
this is my advie	75895.0
you do not look well .	4939.9158854741
" oh ! - your uncle ! - he keeps a man servant , does he ? - i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .	39050.71750009564
he was growing quite inattentieto other people , and wholly engrossed by her .	13090.271809995065
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !	75895.00000000004
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	20829.084831242395
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	23473.800372917478
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lie so long in derbyshie "	337.3838105192326
" mr bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?	27266.918909728927
" an unhappy alternatieis before you , elizabeth .	86642.37295791638
how odious i should think them ! "	19801.95205839113
" oh !	75895.0
at our tieof lie it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .	33619.628958853726
at length however mr bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no lieihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	10218.511752022008
her niece was , therefore , oblie to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposiesieof the rie , in the nearest dietion ; but their progress was slow , for mr gardie , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	inf
" no , she would go home .	75895.00000000004
fiedaughters successiey entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mr bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would .	10493.206280873084
he arranges the busies just as he pleases . "	92574.41316025672
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remaie in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiets .	15574.26275847387
but that is nothing to us .	1953.0881083707652
i want to talk very seriously .	10116.615338674132
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well .	28440.92640721233
elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly ; " - and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .	5025.112933873133
darcy . "	75895.0
mr gardie went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshiefriend , that had attended her from that part of the world .	28651.602113531313
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ?	806.8024161448501
" why did not you all learn ? - you ought all to have learned .	14845.659129119505
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to - she is lost for ever . "	21326.088401893634
bingley intended it lieie and sometie made choieof his county ; but as he was now provie with a good house and the liety of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easies of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	16285.343870461633
" you have insulted me , in every possible method .	5979.936190764348
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provie for .	16631.430062008592
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .	1638.5326746599553
mr wickham ' s happies and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .	9697.404031774853
" you appear to me , mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .	7851.47180273941
she felt anew the justieof mr darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .	16562.06061291471
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him . "	81580.62405717962
chapter xxiii	112918.3917531993
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can gieit .	12272.507895539418
" it may do very well for the others , " replied mr bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .	1352.9469548274658
" _that_ will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_ . "	41621.36862266034
she had even condescended to adviehim to marry as soon as he could , provie he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , - some shelves in the closets up stairs .	22982.903646639556
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham ' s being among them .	30354.47767266128
" perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .	75894.99999999996
they agreed that mr bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewaie it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .	5629.744799923732
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same tiedreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	16925.09533621098
" ' tis an etiquette i despie " said he .	85018.53149545338
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least liey to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	8307.300397442854
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .	15728.610808559037
but prie where there is a real superiority of mind , priewill be always under good regulation . "	24756.430799559912
elizabeth tried to be dieted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .	28338.001496111818
elizabeth told her the motie of her secrecy .	75895.0
i appeal to mr darcy : - but let me not interrupt you , sir . - you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "	14747.263082633934
" upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you gieyour opinion very deciely for so young a person . - pray , what is your age ? "	21548.45164855911
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "	6277.2157489876345
where is your sash my dear ? "	86642.68547571392
wickham is safe . "	75894.99999999996
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .	12884.156417531536
no , no , this is not liey .	9304.110400123413
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .	81090.97739070177
his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justie	7934.666411306819
but still he would be her husband . - without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happies , must be their pleasantest preservatiefrom want .	43009.52571618986
did he know of their intending to go off ?	24655.0907971266
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "	3933.699201087965
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not receie written confirmation of compliance .	11856.620658625872
resignation to ieitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned .	3635.4230849532696
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the busies . "	8057.06485712401
this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .	10714.905714957305
sir william only smie .	75895.0
mr collins ' s return into hertfordshiewas no longer a matter of pleasure to mr bennet .	18254.50441530075
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me - but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love . "	53911.041059819785
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .	11434.580780501146
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . - " he is now gone into the army , " she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . "	5197.842880371184
oh , sister !	75895.0
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "	92251.0768216725
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .	10278.564856937373
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshie had been the means of uniting them .	21078.789903625904
" the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "	4367.33785192153
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometie it seemed nothing but absence of mind .	32802.684096373465
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? "	3551.8491262129646
see paragraph <NUMBER> . c below .	9146.434904825317
that he should even speak to her was amazing ! - but to speak with such civility , to enquieafter her family !	26992.33082068141
how can they suit each other ? - do you know mr	38608.9208775022
" i cannot believe it .	44950.62150902436
" i leave it to yourself to determie " said mr bennet .	75895.00000000004
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestraie wonder , and when at last mr collins allowed him tieto speak , replied with an air of distant civility .	38912.36680629934
her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .	7043.657961548305
you may have drawn him in . "	95588.83302026904
but i cannot - i have never desie your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .	15140.184824503112
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry .	12310.15712323844
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .	6145.658319305833
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were dieted to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .	12022.57958192537
she had obtaie private intelliece that mr darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	31473.473120743605
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was oblie to go the next day for a short tie	16372.331058440452
mr bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclie to be siet himself .	15654.70713229266
" it must not be thought of .	3319.575448637406
" and this is your real opinion !	2720.8536446836088
they may be modified and printed and gie away - you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks .	50927.56939764641
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling .	21340.957922553895
and i think you will agree with me , in consieing a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s .	42732.32220262802
miss darcy , though with a diffiece which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .	22368.947525622018
" if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . "	19749.50429156774
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .	35154.773035062935
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your ie of an accomplished woman . "	8111.877431748855
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	22774.774988169855
" but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "	61305.72691234483
cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the tieso precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr darcy appeared .	15569.947749295236
" mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s library . "	51585.57701646457
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .	30565.632926551032
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelliece to send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain .	6738.118184128781
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .	657.064218853815
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .	27006.92476356034
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "	13217.082103372773
that his two sisters and mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determiewhether the siet contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smie of the ladies , were more intolerable .	10789.451666309655

she will be down in a moment i dare say . "	1299.6216199285973
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone .	28297.821189162198
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .	8741.55340862324
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praie	16593.30960721021
his accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliet it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .	11741.98479513754
is it true ? "	75894.99999999996
" i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . - we may compare our different opinions . "	22405.321749939572
" indeed i am .	75894.99999999996
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "	5035.6268543310325
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	1043.3241527059147
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband .	8105.960408303232
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .	80040.24760248432
he takes them now for people of fashion . "	75895.0
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quieunprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smie at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his priehad revolted , in his offer to herself .	24714.622263359153
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other sie allowed them to see him before they met .	23925.277667743212
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	25345.123082690287
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - " this walk is not wieenough for our party .	75895.0
elizabeth had receie none since her return , that could come from pemberley .	61223.2828797019
" it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "	75894.99999999996
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .	53450.987206631
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .	14023.938573584359
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and whiemr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress .	58777.70957936843
mr hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustieof her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	28798.6234896391
" i am talking of possibilities , charles . "	86642.68547571392
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth consieed as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard .	18963.06493552671
elizabeth now began to revie	75895.00000000004
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	24207.06578417898
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	4089.9875066822806
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world .	40430.083802297704
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !	24111.155951439854
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "	75894.99999999996
" she is a most charming young lady indeed .	3281.020316447826
what news ?	75895.0
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entiey on her sister and mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .	21731.85648116251
let wickham be _your_ man .	75895.00000000004
it is unaccountable !	75894.99999999996
good bye . "	75895.0
when at length they arose to take leave , mr bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any tie without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	8269.666925375242
with many compliets to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , - to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mr bennet , with more perseverance than polieess , protested he must be entiey mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaie , " good lord !	32462.619372493053
had i but explaie some part of it only - some part of what i learnt , to my own family !	9705.3320346447
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	449.7839596599508
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .	75894.99999999996
well , how pleased i am !	75895.00000000004
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight !	31577.47299376765
i believe i have now told you every thing .	39261.71318036628
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty .	75895.00000000004
with the gardies , they were always on the most intimate terms .	12934.343183611634
with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !	21335.702862304595
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ . "	75895.00000000003
she shared in their attendance on mr bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	4063.8758977376524
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her - that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	1968.9323628786894
" i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley .	75895.0
i do not know who is good enough for him . "	423.65647184103403
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second tiewith ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wies offers of refreshment .	11620.11191231815
he wiey resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an ie had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	34414.0883561341
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished .	8871.215127068326
" i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advie	8029.233180201856
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happies she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	21396.434549350673
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lie .	26480.27753352054
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "	3526.0212951607823
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , - " you must be surprie , very much surprie , - so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you .	10757.761716732464
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .	4531.37624282966
" what is there of good to be expected ? "	49228.986604607744
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .	86106.7113935576
he had been some tiewith mr gardie , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the rie , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .	10199.840909188733
after walking some tiein this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the rie for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	43173.93233462185
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	13417.471160932866
darcy was not of a disposition in which happies overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besie the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	13896.92452626946
said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determiewhat to say in reply .	8702.046756118967
the offies of the - shiewere in general a very creditable , gentleman lieset , and the best of them were of the present party ; but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wie who followed them into the room .	32399.21297069244
she was not rendered formidable by siece ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritatiea tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherieto be exactly what he had represented .	8308.843059139366
" good heavens ! "	112918.3917531993
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invie to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declie it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short tieshe could stay below with a book .	26203.248457976923
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wiey in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	42954.34540256033

" perfectly so - i thank you . "	75895.00000000004
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy .	2597.2076653105164
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	75894.99999999996
i remember the tiewhen i lie a red coat myself very well - and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with fieor six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regietals . "	19839.966053504788
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceiepeople as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	4373.197298190632
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	27332.84508719246
but as it is - you must not let your fancy run away with you .	4818.470345433751
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long .	5690.765899839793
" no , indeed , i did not . - i knew nothing at all of lady catheries connections .	1459.357579391012
" i believe she did - and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "	4950.918107859763
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	11942.197179857723
mr gardie gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different tie between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , gie up the acquaintance .	20198.758797069346
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to diet his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	10108.160699874566
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? "	82171.92650691097
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spieof the pains you took to disguieyourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despie the persons who so assiduously courted you .	32676.030983119086
it is something to think of , and gie her a sort of distinction among her companions .	21751.38871877807
they could descriean entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .	82900.75187025058
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .	30395.02083965573
i must speak to hill , this moment . "	70560.65083609264

perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voie which was not lieease .	30274.1911098469
" do not gieway to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	9622.998953812503
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "	19414.18233255362
" if you were to gieme forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .	15353.634322697704
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .	24094.158155267174
darcy was fie in astonishment .	75895.00000000004
at present i will say nothing about it . "	1608.7881813422798
bingley . - it was an animating subject , and mr bennet seemed incapable of fatigue whieenumerating the advantages of the match .	17916.18393934348

contact the foundation as set forth in section <NUMBER> below .	3185.461731750436
" of what are you talking ? "	768.1173104969554
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promie adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .	2438.7547084074477
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ?	1907.5037602688062
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy .	6177.249954706117
" very true ; and if i had my will , we should .	8551.5526363813
this was agreed to , and mr philips protested that they would have a niecomfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .	54256.47686432395
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .	62562.02255583759

in a doleful voiemr bennet thus began the projected conversation . - " oh !	94260.69805843999
mr collins , meanwhie was meditating in solitude on what had passed .	29740.05056897619
lady lucas began dietly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excie before , how many years longer mr bennet was liey to lie and sir william gave it as his decie opinion , that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james ' s .	15097.219511625579
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "	75894.99999999996

mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .	15485.658600977424
" yes , my youngest is not sixteen .	75894.99999999996
he heard her with astonishment .	28314.017951124457
