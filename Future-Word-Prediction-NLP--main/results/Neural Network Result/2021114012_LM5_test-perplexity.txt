sir william and lady lucas are determie to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .
	1.23512362993168
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifieto her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .
	1.2077572627695277
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .
	1.209141201902524
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well . "
	1.311377283836124
_that_ is all to be forgot .

" he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is liey to suffer from all his lie "

" la ! "

the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .

all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road .

i dare say the lace upon mr hurst ' s gown - " here she was interrupted again .
	1.3312100552040935
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lie by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .
	1.175311275566584
" whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes .

only think what a mieable summer else we shall have ! "
	1.5726961014611216
oh !
	18.52144218810643
" yes , very different .
	2.6641525321532247
how much you must have gone through ! "
	1.8392879318636501
but i suppose you had no opportunity .

but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "

proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .
	1.3029575599219554
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband .
	1.295729228739057
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .
	1.875200646487996
he takes them now for people of fashion . "
	1.6928921149279883
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other sie allowed them to see him before they met .
	1.3089874818362344
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .
	1.6380380741488285
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - " this walk is not wieenough for our party .
	1.3168182340817585
elizabeth had receie none since her return , that could come from pemberley .
	1.4910407032275543
" it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "
	1.24964281476204
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you .
	1.5044471953904066
and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .
	1.483031683781862
" i am talking of possibilities , charles . "
	1.6991029923197074
elizabeth now began to revie
	3.0233201140516988
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .
	1.858249441653858
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .
	1.2260206747160012
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world .
	1.2881973315892286
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
	1.3540983542305456
i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "
	1.5420182609834472
" she is a most charming young lady indeed .
	1.7395809069553374
what news ?
	8.136496036145756
let wickham be _your_ man .
	2.5294323293360366
it is unaccountable !
	4.551662990077242
good bye . "
	3.7331881219712897
had i but explaie some part of it only - some part of what i learnt , to my own family !
	1.3190659109088454
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
	1.2594064796296949
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy .
	1.7337089740669052
well , how pleased i am !
	2.42314047261696
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight !
	1.4627451617378717
i believe i have now told you every thing .
	1.730892755687589
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty .
	1.4193142031026746
with the gardies , they were always on the most intimate terms .
	1.540791696526639
with _your_ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !
	1.4088135547028626
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _me_ . "
	1.452358216957594
she shared in their attendance on mr bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .
	1.273942305347136
" i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley .
	1.3429663036216353
i do not know who is good enough for him . "
	1.5393343930458931
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished .
	1.3987614574874667
" i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advie
	1.341679516912746
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lie .
	1.464743896277269
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "
	1.1866291922402057
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .
	1.5186632586670927
" what is there of good to be expected ? "
	1.6013567554146095
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .
	1.4864783588443924
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .
	1.4839809506950743
said she , " i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determiewhat to say in reply .
	1.3211503424577367
" good heavens ! "
	3.0153988697561003
* * * * * mr gardie soon wrote again to his brother .
	1.4894780294505408
" his misfortunes ! "
	3.0121839632621477
_she_ will not be able to help calling . "
	1.6736198211015332
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .
	1.1738164634908956
" my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .
	1.3912659139309413
" indeed ! "

if the second copy is also defectie you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem .
	1.285723998664866
my dear mr bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .
	1.2363878893668263
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?
	1.2682765824604558
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promie to play to him ; and she sat down dietly to the instrument .
	1.232675179282769
and for _this_ we are to be thankful .
	1.8535271064531815
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .
	1.7561766178401546
his surpriewas great .
	4.570775245391882
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas .
	1.855839595051988
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
	1.6134229713082129
" upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself . "
	1.3324375346929154
he promie fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .
	1.219538388103771
i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me .
	1.6558320085758984
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .
	1.2064179671711566
i wish you had been there , my dear , to have gie him one of your set downs .
	1.3140711834512298
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .
	1.452601536715823
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?
	1.9918235644130573
elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy , was in such miey of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .
	1.2211305096679597
" mr darcy is all polieess , " said elizabeth , smiling .
	1.6022906352135287
" you are not going to introduce yourself to mr

maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admie
	1.37941866000859
these are conditions , which , consieing every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privieed , for you .
	1.227823777263122
elizabeth was not surprie at it , as jane had written the dietion remarkably ill .
	1.4026639102938037
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .
	1.4522392317639328
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn .
	1.2861689036015316
lady catheriewill not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .
	1.5417328882200214
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of prieand impertiece ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .
	1.2130521594713326
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .
	1.4931553192759215
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the liey of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .
	1.246063373818319
yes , there was something in _that_ ; i told you so from the first , you may remember . "
	1.2783743427275784
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .
	1.285816907559647
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you ca not think .
	1.4557036836123498
her ladyship was highly incensed .
	2.555448889745491
i am so pleased - so happy .
	2.096665303846676
there could be no conversation in the noieof mr philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .
	1.2529860517129536
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose _him_ . "
	1.3866389035065887
how i long to see her !
	2.4111086478214245
it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .
	1.5459286563647587
there is nothing he would not do for her . "
	1.6004574176404618
elizabeth will soon be the wieof mr darcy .
	1.8701343670177424
from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent .
	1.7282528650521864
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would - i do congratulate you - but are you certain ?
	1.3588800530372134
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?
	1.6625924630212574
" as soon as ever mr bingley comes , my dear , " said mr bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "
	1.2124044094927828
to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admie her - indeed i rather believe he _did_ - i heard something about it - but i hardly know what - something about mr
	1.2214483743567803
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mr gardie it had a peculiarly strong attraction .
	1.1941388766258672
it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .
	1.4088499882120995
" she looks sickly and cross . - yes , she will do for him very well .
	1.3515326324175514
" that is not very liey ; our authority was too good . "
	1.4409846561107882
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet receie pleasure from observing his behaviour .
	1.3568118536292675
mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .
	1.2822124976504174
" yes ; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not giehis real opinion about it .
	1.23774559268321
" what does mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? "
	1.2406717636607347
" oh ! "
	4.022789383027674
" you mistake me , my dear .
	2.082425378903708
she added , " by far too much .
	1.8612608967617852
consie how important every moment is , in such a case . "
	1.4816226220406092
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receiea return .
	1.2639426627219554
" yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly .
	1.5761585779906175
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .
	1.2690227689870068
said she .
	7.448525409441444
my father , however , is partial to mr wickham .
	1.6549187548126143
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joie them , and good naturedly engaged mr collins ' s conversation to herself .
	1.215561178045164
it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .
	1.3270570159275674
his countenance , voie and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .
	1.3358380128776133
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourie but i think i shall lie_your_ husband quieas well as jane ' s . "
	1.2509842368125879
the former was divie between admiration of the brilliancy which exerciehad gie to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone .
	1.2020121520183245
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admiehim ; but so we all were .
	1.3279911708093186
" yes , in conjunction with his friend . "
	1.6813058547657678
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .
	1.565553594827295
but we consieed it , we talked of it as impossible .
	1.5950713507479732
darcy ! - and so it does i vow .
	1.7714794928229094
" another tie lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with _him_ , if i were you . "
	1.241407084982191
we do not suffer by _acciet_ .
	2.2357269460580933
in three volumes .
	4.2240890619524265
cried mr bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley !
	1.219053937538394
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .
	1.5284622666714451
but it is so strange ! "
	2.155222504791877
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .
	1.2845384278226308
" my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party .
	1.197636770523231
forgiethe question - are you quiecertain that you can be happy with him ? "
	1.4127205721144054
this has been my motie my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .
	1.2782905334116395
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .

the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg lieary archiefoundation .

but you know married women have never much tiefor writing .

but of every other neglect i can believe him capable .

dear me !

the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshie could not in rational expectation surviesuch a blow as this .
	1.217799108173467
chapter x elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .
	1.3134191117269343
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .
	1.21688421338104
" i am all astonishment .
	2.6911527155486046
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promie make _their_ marriage at all more probable ?
	1.2527188437865762
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your priviee of uniesal good will .
	1.2795764106559706
that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .
	1.4673688628304353
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will _make_ her know it . "

" i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him .
	1.3823736227851897
i congratulate her .

he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .

" yes , indeed , and receie no inconsieable pleasure from the sight .
	1.4696212236650286
i know your disposition , lizzy .

_too much_ , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promie for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ?
	1.209218841836423
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected .
	1.18164755663085
in short , i will do my best . "
	1.6759946851322407
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquieafter her .
	1.3670906011904131
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .
	1.3174135598322265
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object .
	1.4828141619274802
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprie to find that he meditated a quick return .
	1.2807686399612501
" you cannot be too much on your guard .
	1.7512643441987221
" in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "
	1.3583655016028109
you never see a fault in any body .
	1.848391263492986
what a fiething for our girls ! "
	1.9761706413367708
she was sure they should be married some tieor other , and it did not much signify when .
	1.345717997408477
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .
	1.3418714689071143
catherieand lydia had information for them of a different sort .
	1.6476818805002618
mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in his lie
	1.3552961894294988
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more lieher .
	1.4946842380312124
i must find mr gardie this moment , on busies that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose . "
	1.241550849263009
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton !
	1.5481399315404853
" in point of composition , " said mary , " his letter does not seem defectie
	1.3885576075706103
yet tieand her aunt moved slowly - and her patience and her ies were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over .
	1.2242979084373193
that the wish of giving happies to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny .
	1.221100641962774
cried mr gardie .
	4.232970119188763
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "
	1.3591947554357162
a lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .
	1.2536436300795193
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?
	1.557727292290667
however , your coming just at this tieis the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "
	1.1896360842232405
i cannot quieagree with you _there_ .
	2.2283844433817857
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .
	1.2852563243954518
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve .
	1.2662234681911673
he replied , and was again siet .
	2.003536634652792
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .
	1.4066306341910317
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometie did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .
	1.1782176789094336
who could have imagie that we should receiean invitation to diethere ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "
	1.2197615875090888
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .
	1.2708910408306455
" and pray may i ask ? "
	1.9229861999058733
in this danger kitty is also comprehended .
	2.0284220249103937
" he brought it with him for us to see . "
	1.5354434211643542
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .
	1.24248860098743
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .
	1.333958086081352
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "
	1.4499353107018598
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .

but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ?
	1.3627540586819047
" it is well .
	3.202799984941153

there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter , which promie well .

said mr gardie .

to his wiehe was very little otherwieindebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .

the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back .
	1.4162208148668585
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs .
	1.6727378011912417
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .

he was my godfather , and excessiey attached to me .
	1.644809726578081
their powers of conversation were consieable .
	2.2321710117905957
i am sure i sha ' nt get a wink of sleep all night .
	1.4525036318645042
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .
	1.1955629957558593
and then when we came away it was such fun !
	1.7611449328434643
they were in fact very fieladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceie .

elizabeth looked expressiey at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh !

- cried elizabeth .
	4.398292512925903
the far and the near must be relatie and depend on many varying circumstances .
	1.45920887379177
i am not qualified to form one .

" i have sent for you on an affair of importance .

what could she mean by it ?
	2.4209934201468015
in a short tie i shall have a daughter married .
	1.649719920085665
" what think you of _this_ sentence , my dear lizzy ? "
	1.4979403136388887
she could not determiehow her mother would take it ; sometie doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .
	1.206556551853254
" i hope not . "

" ah !

bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening mr bennet ' s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .
	1.1772897808495348
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .
	1.1782745782124358
do any thing rather than marry without affection .
	1.8821074726551363
" miss elizabeth bennet ! "
	2.481584358874616
i hope she will turn out well . "
	1.7720828794013728
" something very much to the purpose of course .
	1.7541581158380826
" you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .
	1.217665771664847
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn . "
	1.3763932049483836
it was very little less .
	2.517089827979005
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement .
	1.4456531131450965
miss bingley is to liewith her brother and keep his house ; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "
	1.1870321904725551
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come . "
	1.3828216275622534
the insipidity and yet the noie the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people ! - what would i gieto hear your strictures on them ! "
	1.1956957122660175
" miss bingley , " said he , " has gie me credit for more than can be .
	1.3428535924371012
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .
	1.2532802139955876
our situation with regard to lady catheries family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .
	1.2936910695848545
bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .
	1.6637452511369857
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .
	1.2349255641574743
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great .
	1.778058748491004
what do you keep winking at me for ?
	1.995989614781039
" undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometie condescend to employ for captivation .
	1.1912730214933474
have a little compassion on my nerves .
	2.034643134041012
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .
	1.3375695004478985
" yes , she called yesterday with her father .
	1.7464637021723688
" you have insulted me , in every possible method .
	1.673201158004263
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provie for .
	1.1796500998304065
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .
	1.3366456146711574
mr wickham ' s happies and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .
	1.191671315731452
" you appear to me , mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .
	1.324685387635299
she felt anew the justieof mr darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .
	1.1912545431567958
at least , you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him . "
	1.4492486874979136
chapter xxiii
	15.402741744352168
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can gieit .
	1.251807198078442
" it may do very well for the others , " replied mr bingley ; " but i am sure it will be too much for kitty .
	1.2242064212153385
" _that_ will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _me_ . "
	1.239582206989602
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham ' s being among them .
	1.5192740263823319
" perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .
	1.6076005189176463
" ' tis an etiquette i despie " said he .
	1.6708251481616787
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .
	1.263766484159556
but prie where there is a real superiority of mind , priewill be always under good regulation . "
	1.3129115679820613
elizabeth tried to be dieted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .
	1.3640766359154957
elizabeth told her the motie of her secrecy .
	1.9126489145495624
" upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you gieyour opinion very deciely for so young a person . - pray , what is your age ? "
	1.182591321449539
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "
	1.2617075711561723
where is your sash my dear ? "
	1.914331928927564
wickham is safe . "
	2.863140849882957
no , no , this is not liey .
	1.8829902825859515
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .
	1.5234101557021225
did he know of their intending to go off ?
	1.8430656075013245
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "
	1.4019688663449186
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not receie written confirmation of compliance .
	1.3931588082140767
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the busies . "

sir william only smie .
	3.167682728224882
mr collins ' s return into hertfordshiewas no longer a matter of pleasure to mr bennet .
	1.3868302215614703
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me - but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love . "
	1.23670844458052
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night .
	1.3564653041863077
oh , sister !
	4.54035480172953
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "
	1.6285700859944823
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .
	1.2662617590700376
" the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "
	1.381824110771144
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometie it seemed nothing but absence of mind .
	1.2077768108783706
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? "
	1.4131965201977632
see paragraph <NUMBER> . c below .
	2.24804981560907
that he should even speak to her was amazing ! - but to speak with such civility , to enquieafter her family !
	1.3023722432400555
how can they suit each other ? - do you know mr
	1.7801750690380123
" i cannot believe it .
	2.5846452781943574
" i leave it to yourself to determie " said mr bennet .
	1.5368485291664429
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestraie wonder , and when at last mr collins allowed him tieto speak , replied with an air of distant civility .
	1.2263029624022883
her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .
	1.3115228663514258
you may have drawn him in . "
	1.9316051486652595
but i cannot - i have never desie your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
	1.3065057697874745
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them marry .
	1.1992305405649337
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .
	1.438251820499386
she had obtaie private intelliece that mr darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
	1.24529425382368
mr bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclie to be siet himself .
	1.1874947590375302
" it must not be thought of .
	2.085722015068476
" and this is your real opinion !
	2.12142526280663
they may be modified and printed and gie away - you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks .
	1.3202689203916498
and i think you will agree with me , in consieing a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s .
	1.2089086040079906
miss darcy , though with a diffiece which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .
	1.3097678315105499
" if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . "
	1.3814403863147227
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford .
	1.4224395314479028
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your ie of an accomplished woman . "
	1.2503844933114414
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .
	1.2216319903959336
" but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "
	1.2184718344679917
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it .
	1.521996235719416
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelliece to send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain .
	1.2166909714061054
i am sure you will be very comfortable there .
	1.749917209743641
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .
	1.2338647396161184
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "
	1.357792374189203
this is the last tiei shall ever remember it myself . "
	1.5407571049263893
she will be down in a moment i dare say . "
	1.5356957577128112
what i have to say relates to poor lydia .
	1.7521413798282508
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praie
	1.3861889454513336
is it true ? "
	2.8816628961630926
" i am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . - we may compare our different opinions . "
	1.164256338319995
" indeed i am .
	3.3935902388404444
for my part , i am determie never to speak of it again to anybody .
	1.4131592475733554
" but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .
	1.2226996543388016
darcy ? "
	5.8344050411895
but do not be cast down .
	2.209375294186776
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
	1.2354628569086759
" no - i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "
	1.3330902527460289
he inquie how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there .

chapter ix
	15.402741744352168
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
	1.288460198773587
" but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consieation in the world , " replied darcy .
	1.287738435765261
" caroliedeciely says that none of the party will return into hertfordshiethis winter .
	1.4920868994658683
" no , i should have turned in a moment . "
	1.5326777679134953
his sisters were fiewomen , with an air of decie fashion .
	1.5951814282273462
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .
	1.3590769377433227
" miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with .

i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement .
	1.416886561200212
by this tieshe is actually with them !
	2.113189770877233
mr bennet could hardly contain herself .
	2.224755035581378
well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "
	1.3511086688869203
mary was the only daughter who remaie at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mr bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone .
	1.1960830787197794
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .
	1.1885533544086035
" you are quieright .
	3.20905760763041
i know not what to think .
	2.2589851168261195
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their unie volubility .
	1.2255648121901197
have not you always hated him ? "
	1.9256042044401334
thought elizabeth .
	7.16113120573324
" they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them . "
	1.3812138113786077
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .
	1.5146800058213061
to mr gardie , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .
	1.3552080351040368
" _i_ never saw such a woman .
	2.0468347532669213
" you forget that i have made no answer .
	1.7426481400114426
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .
	1.874722018468633
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .
	2.3924828879645212
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtaie my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
	1.1886924201420932
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : - and to have mr collins instead !
	1.3492123101132911
" this fieaccount of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quieconsistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "
	1.2030408947911997
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .
	1.1953575250717243
jane was so admie , nothing could be lieit .
	1.7342610960963756
" i know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder .
	1.4586007094828781
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentiey ; and i could then perceiethat his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .
	1.1846035951239478
after a short siece , the lady first spoke .
	1.7803633650133326
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "
	1.1952196848047518
elizabeth almost stared at her . - " can this be mr
	1.7858401841724496
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .
	1.2823719543865149
elizabeth could not repress a smieat this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .
	1.3286990193494996
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .
	1.5257424380003544
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "
	1.2403168728892882
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .
	1.2075483175172748
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .
	1.180924169917676
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "
	1.2082398985556033
cried elizabeth , " i am excessiey dieted .
	1.8661839187723204
i told my sister philips so the other day .
	1.7114502172526673
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again . "
	1.2804307214861115
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; - but darcy , at whom it was all aie , was still inflexibly studious .
	1.2374028846318492
the distance is nothing , when one has a motie only three mie .
	1.4917206483340024
it would have suie me in every respect . "
	1.6737399126324939
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must gieyou pain , but it was necessary .
	1.3033992156728553
she has known him only a fortnight .
	2.0230416208892437
people do not die of little trifling colds .
	1.8715187454905102
the gardies staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the offies , there was not a day without its engagement .
	1.207513858892925
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence .
	1.3300484441379778
elizabeth , on her sie had much to do .
	1.7457320192997654
jane shook her head .
	3.2208169749215636
" which do you mean ? "
	2.117291441130475
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .
	1.1746303176795438
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some acciet been lost .
	1.2497361827774265
when elizabeth had rejoie over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiet .
	1.2572830650702382
i never saw such a long chin in my lie
	2.1683549559609028
miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .
	1.282936195352308
said she .
	7.448525409441444
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .
	1.3161608887828509
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .
	1.3578827654594399
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drieby my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "
	1.2669580191775531
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .
	1.6556760005582205
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its wrie were at tie wiey different .
	1.3922355492773408
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .
	1.1792490538603377
two obstacles of the fiebeing thus removed , mr bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catheriefor a consieable tie without making any impression on them .
	1.2131948027689
" you must not blame my aunt .
	2.0264278344332567
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .
	1.2432655977272158
i am not equal to it .
	2.2180417487403514
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little besieexpressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .
	1.1808696708083068
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .
	1.4489662963964787
the surprieof such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .
	1.2475260086145115
" i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .
	1.4130173546087617
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wiey in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .
	1.2806901075961652
chapter ix
	15.402741744352168
" perfectly so - i thank you . "
	1.778438926105111
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy .
	1.373333924116132
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .
	1.8673505558648655
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .
	1.2080151705435478
but as it is - you must not let your fancy run away with you .
	1.4113599042528715
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long .
	1.4374483166159642
" no , indeed , i did not . - i knew nothing at all of lady catheries connections .
	1.3426623621024922
" i believe she did - and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "
	1.2412476540276245
or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? "
	1.498181847095924
it is something to think of , and gie her a sort of distinction among her companions .
	1.3600895695632294
they could descriean entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .
	1.2988784028759637
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you .
	1.2359620407263505
i must speak to hill , this moment . "
	1.6804664858857978
" la !
	7.632497423247497
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voie which was not lieease .
	1.2239816479528116
" if you were to gieme forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .
	1.3443899786114473
darcy was fie in astonishment .
	2.675164159783458
at present i will say nothing about it . "
	1.6750223719298811
bingley . - it was an animating subject , and mr bennet seemed incapable of fatigue whieenumerating the advantages of the match .
	1.2716623996936645
but it has been the study of my lieto avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "
	1.2643555305411347
contact the foundation as set forth in section <NUMBER> below .
	1.6671289901257287
" of what are you talking ? "
	1.9101990685820556
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ?
	1.365687767342163
" very true ; and if i had my will , we should .
	1.5115267311126108
this was agreed to , and mr philips protested that they would have a niecomfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .
	1.2105630715863487
into _one_ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .
	1.532104937726348
" and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body . "
	1.487249726511659
in a doleful voiemr bennet thus began the projected conversation . - " oh !
	1.4786156075468093
mr collins , meanwhie was meditating in solitude on what had passed .
	1.545995318399659
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "
	1.683179304619284
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr wickham and herself .
	1.3767951419078974
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg tm liese for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work .
	1.1978668853418333
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "
	1.379178118851961
" neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .
	1.228644974851094
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .
	1.479966690062838
" yes , my youngest is not sixteen .
	1.8597510840141018
he heard her with astonishment .
	2.6878685826586213
wickham , lydia , were all forgotten .
	2.0321030094778756
he could number the fields in every dietion , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .
	1.2691811431460078
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
mr wickham !
	7.300971236761791
her lieies had been never worse tie .
	2.0390693534569513
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .
	2.006707275666498
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr bingley - is not he ?
	1.512798862410416
indeed he has no improper prie
	2.5848337965714747
oh !
	18.52144218810643
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one sie
	1.6753705559523973
it is as often applied to feelings which ariefrom an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .
	1.2678525596798507
his character was to speak for itself .
	2.0075726301805754
" _mr
	19.08286300300236
" because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .
	1.463391721767516
elizabeth immediately recognising the liey , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .
	1.1863929942636693
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion requie .
	1.2367779400667454
bingley . "
	5.7711386146518135
" one of them does . "
	2.1045794490857848
his temptation is not adequate to the risk . "
	1.684027580848814
i speak nothing but the truth .
	2.227597615873237
but as elizabeth could not receiecomfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .
	1.4041043550205374
" but does lydia know nothing of this ?
	1.9923653501376895
mr bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense ! "
	1.6563267465454328
" you are joking , lizzy .
	2.3520851526963504
" _that_ is his notion of christian forgieess !
	1.9759094289725916
" it is difficult indeed - it is distressing . - one does not know what to think . "
	1.2934683359427168
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "
	1.335400339658831
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .
	1.6600071904535856
but mr gardie could not be seen , and mr darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .
	1.1764477368633415
" what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifieon my sie and mr darcy had much better finish his letter . "
	1.215984864478841
" what think you of books ? "
	1.9318836671339432
" remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you do . "
	1.3136333775211275
how is half such a sum to be repaid ? "
	1.6070135597853945
for what do we lie but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
	1.2605223661243694
she did indeed .
	4.273831210429975
oh , lord !
	4.626334314459702
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .
	1.3037036125921189
" the country , " said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .
	1.3040504384191334
and his sisters are charming women .
	2.221785447750925
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . "
	1.2548908479742338
unwilling as she was to admit an ie so destructieof jane ' s happies , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .
	1.1829138469025766
" i have not a doubt of mr bingley ' s sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
	1.198359810390627
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .
	1.2295747112066466
" how should you have lie making sermons ? "
	1.6862486341144667
who should suffer but myself ?
	2.821058505265835
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "
	1.620452914852768
pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen !
	1.3592078668769698
i do not wish to avoid the walk .
	1.8520511353105171
let me do it without farther loss of tie
	2.287289562126572
" all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensiereading . "
	1.1641660510816698
but do you always wriesuch charming long letters to her , mr
	1.7692492143817764
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagie
	1.4138174311167762
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admieand love you . "
	1.4086639599025361
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a consieable tiein that very part of derbyshie to which he belonged .
	1.2157194886703804
" no , lizzy , that is what i do _not_ choose .
	1.547143617595543
" and do you impute it to either of those ? "
	1.540792552661225
my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "
	1.3880082298991707
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character .
	1.1936868017847224
" that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .
	1.42038711872539
" and they _must_ marry !
	2.781212168131897
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .
	1.286049123165582
no , lizzy , let me once in my liefeel how much i have been to blame .
	1.3590959197540105
have you had any flirting ?
	2.839560411177818
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .
	1.249230282462125
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lie .
	1.454912019832037
" la !
	7.632497423247497
" yes , ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just liehim - just as affable to the poor . "
	1.1996511837008774
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .
	1.3177741365529305
every day added something to their knowledge of the offies ' names and connections .
	1.4691350834434966
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world !
	1.4461229880258017
i shall then gieover every expectation , every wish of his constancy .
	1.5353630412315145
mr long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not .
	1.4798974723296654
said he ; " that is rather singular . "
	1.6819277535026333
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to wrieexplicitly .
	1.4232435113224395
this is my advie
	4.015734537554535
you do not look well .
	2.5399763991340336
" oh ! - your uncle ! - he keeps a man servant , does he ? - i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .
	1.1943272117759618
he was growing quite inattentieto other people , and wholly engrossed by her .
	1.5055512907399697
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !
	1.6698901625900942
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .
	1.2366013750753702
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .
	1.1896930497096647
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lie so long in derbyshie "
	1.3133869685452482
" mr bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?
	1.4637302578799765
" an unhappy alternatieis before you , elizabeth .
	1.9563520982979794
how odious i should think them ! "
	1.961569410853155
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
at our tieof lie it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .
	1.1847087411670152
" no , she would go home .
	2.0336266465785013
fiedaughters successiey entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and mr bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would .

he arranges the busies just as he pleases . "
	1.6907212894678119
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remaie in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiets .
	1.2579695592050362
but that is nothing to us .
	2.2669299924577624
i want to talk very seriously .
	2.222165967744614
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well .
	1.3663522651459186
elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly ; " - and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .
	1.2724812384480306
darcy . "
	5.808147770706102
mr gardie went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshiefriend , that had attended her from that part of the world .
	1.249019463191205
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ?
	1.278264029474079
" why did not you all learn ? - you ought all to have learned .
	1.4234312217666838
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to - she is lost for ever . "
	1.2615991261264434
did you , on reading it , gieany credit to its contents ? "
	1.440709099922607
but do not imagieit was from any silly cause .

	1.2041420158777263
you know not , you can scarcely conceie how they have tortured me ; - though it was some tie i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justie "
	1.2182737751241497
" but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mr long has promie to introduce him . "
	1.1744203864679974
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regietals to make him completely charming .
	1.2990873593338064
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .
	1.3531093299896626
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "
	1.4442300579307241
" it is eviet by this , " added jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . "
	1.2617197069307762
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "
	1.5981879617079924
he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claie the good wishes and affection of a sister .
	1.2943486990166149
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .
	1.5397359376881248
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me . - no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .
	1.2398200149286613
" i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect .
	1.4929632376757171
who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! "
	1.519791578883192
" let me be rightly understood .
	2.2761815920471666
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaie to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .
	1.2184529399812953
but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is .
	1.4691253539192441
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house .
	1.4852807091700828
" their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget .
	1.235846838172463
i am most seriously displeased . "
	2.1156702996879564
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it . "
	1.4401195874267718
" he is indeed - but consieing the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? "
	1.177531945318952
at such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "
	1.3872898989154447
it was not to be supposed that tiewould gielydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .
	1.2674070167423859
elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure .
	2.203337547350373
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twiemyself , without receiving an answer .
	1.1899416569635606
she was gone dietly .
	3.179487491858058
he had rather hoped that all his wies views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .
	1.2051726699992427
her ease and good spirits increased .
	2.2288965560655556
my father bears it better .
	2.5647690525380895
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .
	1.4122079640122318
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the offies themselves .
	1.33207967389981
can it be really so !
	2.800681931323092
miss bingley i am sure cannot .
	2.2530247418020344
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "
	1.2429011082889387
" and you saw him frequently ? "
	1.9143187857715103
did you see it ? "
	2.3770111347866734
oh , brother , how kind you are !
	1.983190182666667
my feelings in every respect forbid it .
	2.024570637555031
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquieof elizabeth after the health of her family .
	1.2797937619856596
his sister was less delicate , and dieted her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressiesmie
	1.3752863380206208
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .
	1.5419750596754942
i cannot understand it .
	3.094491507049378
i will put on my things in a moment .
	1.7480895312195395
chapter xv
	15.402741744352168
oh !
	18.52144218810643
her character will be fie , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determie flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .
	1.2266110382248185
i know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched up busies , at the expence of your father and uncles .
	1.2098801703048334
" mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself ? "
	1.6042518417648313
" this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desie - splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .
	1.195306805503991
thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! "
	2.509642147898942
dear , dear lizzy .
	3.2609877853053537
" and of this place , " thought she , " i might have been mistress !
	1.4329141727861587
ten thousand a year !
	3.337144771963025
let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "
	1.3916475975165945
" yes - if darcy does not put it off again .
	1.5897706572463155
this cannot be ! - engaged to mr darcy !
	1.803366285848016
" and have you heard from him often ? "
	1.6861874927305283
there was no arguing upon such a project .
	1.8513972288037135
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night .
	1.3236646772313128
" no governess !
	4.687580262118261
the gardies staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .
	1.2612510732053317
" perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister .
	1.5451901195214743
what a contrast between him and his friend !
	1.959110203321831
after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me .
	1.3371643107158029
darcy . - _i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the sieof the room , or the number of couples . "
	1.1855332672184655
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remaie to be said , for the present .
	1.2439542016712
" i believe , ma ' am , i may safely promieyou _never_ to dance with him . "
	1.3104399997245333
when dinner was over , she returned dietly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .
	1.218289105115964
but how little of permanent happies could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .
	1.2001163437592783
" well , well , and so mr bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mr philips first brought her the news . )
	1.2331408056782118
this is the estimation in which you hold me !
	1.8163588024595163
miss lucas is married and settled .
	2.2561749329912
i will go dietly to mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure . "
	1.2513378932444903
" elizabeth , you are not serious now . "
	1.6693323650032974
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will gieyou satisfaction .
	1.181470873394877
well , now let us be quiecomfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .
	1.333029762812975
seriously , i would have you be on your guard .
	1.66729628172775
" my dearest sister , now _be_ be serious .
	1.7613700406955177
the possibility of meeting mr darcy , whieviewing the place , instantly occurred .
	1.5343061795806698
chapter iv
	15.402741744352168
nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .
	1.299098244283753
all field sports were over .
	2.557263364497461
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .
	1.5917640893540212
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
	1.3178104678721276
" bingley . "
	3.772983171276623
i have not the smallest hope .
	2.3882044544904706
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .
	1.433896934539429
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , whiethe servants remaie .
	1.4904510605450536
your tempers are by no means unlie
	2.251503302903481
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .
	1.2841317952088562
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintaie herself by letting lodgings .
	1.3370623721844725
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . "
	1.5348779863916058
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "
	1.5158690735902975
" it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "
	1.2395723381957744
it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq .
	1.5612545955179014
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do .
	1.4878311173379897
you gieme fresh lieand vigour .
	2.5983051552181444
they now walked on in siece ; each of them deep in thought .
	1.471701590430084
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the siece of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .
	1.241651189651097
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
	1.2199866717075096
" implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character .
	1.7793021148794548
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justie
	1.1835258709341272
one came from her books , and the other from her toiete .
	1.5196957130986872
" i am sure , " said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar ' s regiet went away .
	1.2380231849288557
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
darcy had walked away to another part of the room .
	1.639062785076933
mr gardie then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complieted her on bearing it so well .
	1.29756917554649
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would lieto read it . "
	1.2933601385785083
" i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a fie , larger picture of him than this .
	1.2122618997605863
well , much good may it do them !
	1.9532244296426433
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .
	1.2319940161768896
the offies will find women better worth their notie
	1.8556401094234478
his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .
	1.2752658037328783
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected .
	1.2762176200836581
" his prie " said miss lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
	1.2226763554476185
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will gieher .
	1.31944322398436
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them .
	1.5207006719112461
" he only told me , what i have now told you . "
	1.4427960239693773
why must their marriage be private ?
	2.441929203916118
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .
	1.1959829132821678
yet he is _such_ a man ! "
	1.971160256481302
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mr long .
	1.4078984337104343
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "
	1.1869659742318335
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .
	1.3788985456765712
on saturday he came again .
	2.4986231166793886
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decie .
	1.48418901674769
elizabeth was excessiey disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been tieenough .
	1.2604068495633132
this will never do . "
	2.382639110618293
elizabeth shook her head over this letter .
	1.9899971696898244
a scheme of which every part promie delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "
	1.1832349955096566
" oh ! - you mean jane , i suppose - because he danced with her twie
	1.3830736737907292
oh !
	18.52144218810643
lakes , mountains , and ries , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to descrieany particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relatiesituation .
	1.1762728265102267
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young oliebranch .
	1.2698488141417024
she had also asked him twieto dieat rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .
	1.1969023027733998
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
	1.1935457612075482
" i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox !
	1.3347832754732272
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my lie "
	1.5746174137229896
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet , and mr hurst was observing their game .
	1.3756265895569382
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage .
	1.5379107065523177
bingley will not be detaie in london by them . "
	1.599433760741038
elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .
	1.479184607112115
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? "
	1.6051514847273332
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshie she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and rietowards the house .
	1.221475257715803
cried he .
	7.499522493727445
when this was done , she had a less actiepart to play .
	1.5370818235144388
mr bennet raie his eyes from his book as she entered , and fie them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .
	1.1811733541154312
you tear them to pieces . "
	2.109205053437606
elizabeth did not know what to make of it .
	1.7378126876596605
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !
	1.738880469262653
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .
	1.2551765073295873
