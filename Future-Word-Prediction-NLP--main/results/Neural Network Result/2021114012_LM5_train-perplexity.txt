it originated in mr gardie , who , fatigued by the exercieof the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s .
	1.1884797319861933
she blushed at the very ie ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .
	1.2254949350440554
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea .
	1.3761466850401507

elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .

she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voiewhich proved it to be mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate .

in a few minutes , mr bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . "
	1.1917807029238008
" had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? "
	1.6127430748630713
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it .
	1.259647663191413
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .
	1.479267718999101
" you judge very properly , " said mr bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .
	1.2206672122503615
cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? "
	1.553510741300873
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will giesuch pleasure to all my dear family !
	1.3743602746963703

she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .
	1.2710562673746921
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .
	1.2332731196507511
when that busies was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .
	1.3157219654926762
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determie not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .
	1.2031765376013133
you may imagiewhat i felt and how i acted .
	1.7627517889663809
but georgiana would not join her .
	2.2455991133846345
when the ladies were separating for the toiete , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .
	1.2114997031137769
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room . "
	1.2619156859159795
" it is more than i engage for , i assure you . "
	1.4465775951974056
his words seemed to imply it .
	2.2514622541063845
by nature inoffensie friendly and obliging , his presentation at st james ' s had made him courteous .
	1.329980652634563
the strangeness of mr collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .

" he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .

" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .
	1.442164510655818
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .
	1.3978524985122027
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , - what could it mean ?
	1.554960159589177
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it raie hard .
	1.414228868355446
mr bennet could not have chosen better .
	1.9911340262999533

and she was only sixteen last june .
	2.0056601186892062
" to jane herself , " she exclaie , " there could be no possibility of objection .
	1.3641301466438234
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper dietion . "
	1.3139462396047232
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "
	1.26144830537606
i will wrieto my sister gardie about them dietly .

there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will giehim a good name .

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .
	1.2421065869487633
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requie .

then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet .

but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one tie "
	1.3294222283304502
" but if i do not take your lieess now , i may never have another opportunity . "
	1.312984900353457
the effect was immediate .
	3.069421785342674
not that i care about it , though .
	1.9848288471412878
" no .
	9.192290695821296
in another minute mr bingley , but without seeming to have notie what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .
	1.2533616892628585
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .
	1.2622492096679938
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happies again , and promie their father another letter of thanks .
	1.184313388912732
" take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "

but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevaie on to go down without one of her sisters .

a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .
	1.4837007711725763
" indeed i do not dare . "
	1.9024114536029397
" was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , whieshe was ill at netherfield ? "
	1.3197461290538133
without a governess you must have been neglected . "
	1.6839013896855899
" how strange this is !
	2.789289545437096
i do not lieto boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane - one does not often see any body better looking .

kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .
	1.2685293461446738
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .
	1.5450526447617892
" i never can be thankful , mr bennet , for any thing about the entail .
	1.3808427736505728
prierelates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "
	1.2962173570433233
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .
	1.267187990525998
" lizzy , you must not do so .
	1.9071388953712947
i know how much you disliehim . "
	1.912541373337798
you see on what a footing we are .
	1.8706077489224702
" i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr wickham .
	1.1934754080677565
" no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprie "
	1.781294073426931
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .
	1.2635206808640738
" we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either sie " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy .
	1.226562666061526
elizabeth notie every sentence conveying the ie of uneasies , with an attention which it had hardly receie on the first perusal .
	1.2660799098925473
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated tie
	1.2358293178008728
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .
	1.238201965178154
darcy shook his head in siet acquiesence .
	1.9936119882149113
nothing could gieeither bingley or myself more delight .
	1.8791129356172547
you have a sweet room here , mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .

her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us .

" you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .

to catherieand lydia , neither the letter nor its wrie were in any degree interesting .
	1.4085262119090702
" compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .
	1.245051948920237
it is not quiea week since they left brighton .
	1.7305010213137515
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !
	1.771506423701144
" it is a compliet which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . "
	1.3129239196548803
mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .
	1.1845280740778925
" who do you mean , my dear ?
	2.0006665222828928
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper .
	1.3162110381655447
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !
	1.5499852751923893
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .
	1.1952367142807436
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confie and unvarying society . "
	1.4098294347476668
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .
	1.3158582054059913
" i have been used to consie poetry as the _food_ of love , " said darcy .
	1.3787345323632543
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - delieated on the probability of each statement - but with little success .
	1.202466542207685
lord !
	22.050770791821073
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is liey to be in this country much longer . "
	1.195188533451427
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley .
	1.3812395899725614
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .
	1.2925324723810054
_they_ will never be distressed for money .
	2.0220874584420274
" _that_ is a failing indeed ! "
	1.9607503831729782
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .
	1.259248556806895
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "
	1.1884358763880873
had his character been known , this could not have happened .
	1.603331791313199
in revolving lady catheries expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasies as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .
	1.2295201577273769
they are my old friends .
	2.643881556124191
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admie every remarkable spot and point of view .
	1.2675011930066817
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !
	2.1086966797477675
" and will you promieme , never to enter into such an engagement ? "
	1.4192972425892474
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .
	1.4425464740648504
i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .
	1.2108013979522545
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .
	1.1879399463437383
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !
	1.8168954422766674
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .
	1.2861347146125592
" how could i ever think her lieher nephew ? "
	1.60349946817608
mr gardie had seen pemberley , and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well .
	1.3847843462839349
he could not help seeing that you were about fietie as pretty as every other woman in the room .
	1.3065526490448935
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .
	1.2175875938914642
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr and mr gardie were half a quarter of a miebehind .
	1.2349729281608721
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . - i know it cannot be long . "
	1.2927905194874296
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !
	1.8337769927973668
again she read on .
	3.254992741093693
but he is a lieal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . "
	1.2545450695989429
it is almost past belief .
	2.6228774712239296
bingley is most unaffectedly modest .
	2.592712477918402
i declare after all there is no enjoyment liereading !
	1.8405550086838736
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshie my dear cousin .
	1.3316705251771612
" not one . "
	2.8376809389249704
" how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "
	1.5127455249385495
but it must not , shall not be .

" to yield readily - easily - to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you . "
	1.2929565578241053
sir william , how can you tell such a story ? - do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? "
	1.2293927418361408
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character . - oh !
	1.5218115197119941
" i should lieto know how he behaves among strangers . "
	1.542318905704912
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .
	1.3730533526528679
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , fieand twenty years ago .

	1.5917819854326638
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaiethat brought them from epsom .
	1.185236638953164
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to gie and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !
	1.2888419090373817
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .
	1.636004498758332
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .
	1.2953199575744914
" yes , there can ; for mieis totally different . - will you hear it ? "
	1.3343117703490917
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .
	1.616900689534069
it cannot be concealed from any one .
	2.005781300752485
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .
	1.3371510645629958
" there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to gieme no hope from law .
	1.314974627504113
" no , indeed .
	3.3730001182971163
do not imagie miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .
	1.4802198839776828
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "
	1.548161871511628
he bore it however with admirable calmness .
	2.0306155689340204
had they fie on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislie make it so delightfully absurd !
	1.2444876845332442
" what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? "

she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .
	1.473607104481703
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .
	1.2986566409538474
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "
	1.2859369324717282
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .
	1.589172806760691
there was no want of discourse .
	2.2514863247990697
he then said , " i have receie a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .
	1.3628952039801134
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .
	1.892082848485847
dear , yes ; - but you must own she is very plain .
	1.483792512833239
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .
	1.8561112250100305
there was also a postscript to this effect .
	1.8605804145678158
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
	1.7467384616813415
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .
	1.204427903969578
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . "
	1.3803973110335686
console lady catherieas well as you can .
	2.047007222013332
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .
	1.2682113958219758
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a tieexclaie , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourieof his father ! "
	1.177255733036613
" in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .
	1.3566131592048634
mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
	1.3587943529452091
at present we have nothing to guieus .
	2.0183394550429505
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .
	1.2571278140708464
" how can you contrieto wrieso even ? "
	1.7860159228939143
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy .
	1.4493729333010317
" yes , sir , i know i am .
	1.821290911425111
but their removing from the chaieinto an hackney coach is such a presumption !
	1.5470037992863162
its completion depended on others .
	2.622908821705244
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waie , is not it ?
	1.2947063917685835
lady catheries unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .
	1.3814147454098564
" i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .
	1.3898406114575224
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .
	1.2014899793885965
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?
	1.8583163679072345
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? "
	1.4944849525491768
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .
	1.4762130069000519
it is a truth uniesally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wie
	1.2375999463893446
said he , as he joie her .
	2.0349881198612136
jane looked at her doubtingly .
	2.5678179687604135
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .
	1.1893659728709733
" exceed their income !
	3.3468689816949073
elizabeth was surprie , but agreed to it immediately .
	1.7202822900732357
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prie by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .
	1.2147417672459464
no . "
	5.882389955217258
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .
	1.382330797070214
we will go round the park every day .
	1.8530493730261586
" a little sea bathing would set me up for ever . "
	1.4895166609165729
mr collins was also in the same state of angry prie
	1.6702643897486815
" what is it you mean ? "
	1.9214393858595005
" you shall have it in few words .
	1.9250830366075344
this ie lasted whiea turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .
	1.253903890383215
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .
	1.8567207570804536
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .
	1.37787211178416
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .
	1.213217211791818
mr darcy may hug himself . "
	2.1093719484924196
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happies where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoie in his domestic comforts .
	1.1801085565572105
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed !
	1.8377433898953972
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he lie with her . "
	1.1771158226890834
the express was sent off dietly .
	2.2956126098479097
she attracted him more than he lie - and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself .
	1.265779614685121
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .
	1.3849328684335183
she had gaie her point , and had tieto consie of it .
	1.5288699607321832
importance may sometie be purchased too dearly .
	2.0274498773855814
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .
	1.2785294344390505
" i wish i might take this for a compliet ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful . "
	1.230063046972468
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .
	1.4538956671387906
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .
	1.3176007218689374
i saw them the night before last . "
	1.7735035299696666
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
she related the subject of the pictures , the diesions of the rooms , and the prieof the furniture , in vain .
	1.2880540814225523
chapter iii
	15.402741744352168
" i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second tie
	1.6075573381566186
" i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .
	1.2462412569931327
mr reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s lietie
	1.4081877906892288
" but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "
	1.164464861640186
" it must have been his sister ' s doing .
	1.6820601551899503
not one party , or scheme , or any thing .
	1.6706829525972944
" but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "
	1.1804722946632271
" this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "
	1.2510333111607501
" i should be sorry indeed , if it were .
	1.7207699933582559
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .
	1.8485689357562225
your mother insists upon your accepting it .
	2.023667982144957
he does not want abilities .
	2.584713490216571
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .
	1.5935831448829987
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitie .
	1.1845380105409464
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quienorthward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .
	1.219348428207683
let me hear what it is . "
	1.919225582259535
do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "
	1.5942238779246063
is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "
	1.6126870073400963
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .
	1.2793977724508288
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .
	1.4382596679410622
she went on .
	4.360261115359167
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking busies , he was quick in its execution .
	1.3162704517832005
" that is to say , you had gie your permission .
	1.589745071487753
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .
	1.2224003924727662
there is nothing else to be done .
	1.9892200628471144
she saw with the creatieeye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with offies .
	1.3416299384095558
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .
	1.3795728174867992
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . "
	1.2199100354938168
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherie and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were requie .
	1.2080333166507298
what did colonel forster say ?
	2.865185580492039
" i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .
	1.281948741075927
" it was a subject which they could not mention before me . "
	1.4440250169283908
every body said how well she looked ; and mr bingley thought her quiebeautiful , and danced with her twie
	1.3165750548655364
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choie had fortune permitted it .
	1.2172125996173517
you know my sentiets . "
	2.389498684864553
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?
	1.6168017397749401
it was unpardonable .
	4.196146899833649
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .
	1.1833207150434388
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .
	1.5448376555845793
" what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "
	1.5472673324334962
but that is one great difference between us .
	1.881025844335297
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quiedistracted .
	1.2807762360786015
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .
	1.2381568467712376
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . "
	1.3814194108414213
bingley . - but - good lord !
	2.1496732356300328
no thanks to his gallantry for that .
	2.0847929332652635
oh , no . "
	2.92679465500959
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?
	1.5138727698221417
miss darcy ' s praieoccupied the chief of it .
	1.7789268867602406
he readily agreed to it .
	2.59330905288859
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this tieof year . "
	1.353162247020029
chapter ii
	15.402741744352168
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "
	1.2945714109457158
such a countenance , such manners !
	2.358942456887786
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - and perhaps you would not express it quieso strongly anywhere else . - here you are in your own family . "
	1.1625293192319865
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted - " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smie on each other .
	1.1745452095211313
" can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? "
	1.4153037190054045
poor jane !
	7.366188152780147
how acutely did she now feel it .
	1.9943296196374283
" and i have another favour to ask .
	1.8495291416202733
" yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing .
	1.6644546650701217
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .
	1.3179418417387625
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? "
	1.6135342296907924
unfeeling , selfish girl !
	3.3255627897733446
you take delight in vexing me .
	2.2170465107736335
but in what proportions it should be divie amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .
	1.3182966290408675
she is gone down to her uncle at liepool ; gone to stay .
	1.5093147093715766
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .
	1.654628561233882
certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "
	1.2931989348951158
is _her_ husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ?
	1.3597817753208608
" my love , should not you lieto see a place of which you have heard so much ? "
	1.3012751750571179
they will have nothing else to do . "
	1.7812278797363343
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?
	2.0168490446296197
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .
	1.444721861801571
put them next to your great uncle the judge .
	1.7436290895273427
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "
	1.4478150734699173
" yes , she did . "
	2.116524295737036
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception .
	1.2922061793640616
i was ready to die of laughter .
	2.0334021641502824
" perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "
	1.1749308516757944
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffiece , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .
	1.2655678231343275
what a stroke was this for poor jane !
	1.9534352364812442
" this account then is what he has receie from mr darcy .
	1.539179115512321
only look at her .
	3.136804817924919
one seems so forlorn without them . "
	1.9154909096772927
" it is only eviet that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ . "
	1.4129242705302598
" your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "
	1.5953671371640492
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza . "
	1.2429509984905889
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .
	1.3391386592215304
philips . - the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .
	1.411241318734479
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catheriede bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "
	1.2303318004294805
elizabeth immediately began playing again .
	2.539826867708448
for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . "
	1.2233758602582376
" for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . - what advantage can it be to you to offend mr
	1.3434088322619582
" when i consie , " she added , in a yet more agitated voie " that _i_ might have prevented it ! - _i_ who knew what he was .
	1.2047942078091742
letters of busies too !
	3.2708694141124735
she has been allowed to dispose of her tiein the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .
	1.2255956393033633
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just lieyour formality and discretion .
	1.3945496566135216
i have suspected it some tie but i am now convinced . "
	1.4812403808267118
hang kitty !
	7.247943348544544
it was mr collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceie that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .
	1.1905773778027173
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . "
	1.194489231411037
it mortifies me .
	4.254224003769881
chapter ii
	15.402741744352168
" you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherieafter a short siece .
	1.3820920552143425
" i adviemr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mr bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .
	1.2380093441334363
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .
	1.268330032923982
" if he does not come to me , _then_ , " said she , " i shall giehim up for ever . "
	1.2409759033153938
we now come to the point .
	2.2201508516793638
heaven and earth ! - of what are you thinking ?

" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance .

they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister .

she was receie , however , very poliey by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than polieess ; there was good humour and kindness . - mr

" i deserve neither such praienor such censure , " cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things . "
	1.1877961592534048
what has she to do with it ?
	2.1883526116945213
i am happier even than jane ; she only smie , i laugh .
	1.5801662911221084
" your first position is false .
	2.3129282435961542
i wish i could see her .
	2.244647987188641
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home .

it will save me a world of trouble and economy .

" wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .
	1.3263965504421138
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .
	1.9931234523073673
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "
	1.2805710141835442

i am only ashamed of his asking so little . "
	1.6022279987371513
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .
	1.2392750906518897
the first week of their return was soon gone .
	1.7179381564565295
where , where is my uncle ? "
	1.9115293002115612
the party did not supply much conversation .
	2.0113379370594924
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .
	1.1872832782050837
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happies .

it is what every body says .
	2.2212912187314844
oh !
	18.52144218810643
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .
	1.3208995413800066
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more lieherself .
	1.2153235109819756
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .
	1.5619490753267942
you ought certainly to forgiethem as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "
	1.1874839398245571
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confiece one cannot wonder .
	1.2799379906071866
she shall hear my opinion . "
	2.0887620629333603
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .
	1.402075445784234
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .
	1.4694121528842812
" this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he .
	1.3360411018802627
how can mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?
	1.2361454535605374
" i did not know that you intended to walk , " said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .
	1.2387568343729949
and poor mr darcy !
	3.2300374221338086
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "
	1.489606161222799
" no , " said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .

- and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .
	1.276603020451446
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . "
	1.1879190836527247
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . "

make haste , make haste .
	2.65408425803834
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "
	1.3757103785243803
lord bless me !
	4.410038950723166
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .
	1.1744379513638221
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .
	1.9192931350333127
" lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "
	1.168477384156444
he should be particularly happy at any tie & c . & c . ; and if she would giehim leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .
	1.1858109997775774
she could think only of her letter .
	1.9729860774731425
a house in town !
	3.442857546235958
elizabeth hoped she had sieced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprie to see darcy in town last month .
	1.2458860522796078
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have tiefor speech .
	1.4723145144444982
mr gardie looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .
	1.1823542150146533
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "
	1.2129993222079931
darcy made no answer .
	3.0630130688850974
" and that , " said mr reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master - and very liehim .
	1.2513448351949183
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .
	1.5947666023567575
i wrierather slowly . "
	2.8822090768763853
" oh , lord !
	3.432811102894346
accept my thanks for the compliet you are paying me .
	1.6457650134375503
he shook his head . - " i wish i could call her amiable .
	1.4445126173357503
you are so strange !
	3.335101858863803
darcy ! "
	6.461054306545702
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you .
	1.2848569845725533
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceie in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .
	1.2346154255726407
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
	1.282378360220911
chapter ii
	15.402741744352168
i shall now know how to act .
	2.032388752258838
wont it , kitty ? "
	2.4396128059660067
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .
	1.2433977694186809
" we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherieand lydia . - elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .
	1.1977736277103992
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?
	1.2318671284905736
elizabeth was delighted .
	4.260016692003435
but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .
	1.3343836218013516
here comes hill .
	4.619647778932495
" no more have i , " said mr bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "
	1.1937513611946278
" certainly , " he replied , biting his lips .
	1.676194897397772
" i do not believe mr long will do any such thing .
	1.5185876827716933
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .
	1.2276913385719868
jane will be quiean old maid soon , i declare .
	1.7040407098458945
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevaie on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .
	1.1731923245147227
it was eviet that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any ie of ; it was eviet that he was very much in love with her .
	1.182294714093281
you could scarcely escape discredit and miey .
	2.0218515994628463
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again .
	1.520067190038468
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiet of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton . "
	1.1753450351858528
i dare say i shall soon see them here . "
	1.5919292622341463
the park paling was still the boundary on one sie and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .
	1.2802897753230933
elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smie
	1.340191408897498
" i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ?
	1.4022767343056697
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . - daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .
	1.2458644144619986
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly .
	2.2956645096938373
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in tie and the plan became perfect as plan could be .
	1.2913525049234675
a small sum could not do all this . "
	1.6797258141303681
bennet . "
	5.9002512620467185
wretched , wretched , mistake ! "
	2.2231028258029246
yet now i must believe you , " cried jane .
	1.6797048980790459
was a question which elizabeth receie from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .
	1.211338028681485
no aunt , no offies , no news could be sought after ; - the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .
	1.2451342776377516
oh !
	18.52144218810643
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .
	1.1902109177993172
and what can _he_ have to say ? "
	1.779062022874556
" yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .
	1.8581841319157697
said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i am the tallest . "
	1.2513575067107514
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair .
	1.5389427666110076
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr darcy looked up .
	1.3788589935566018
he , who had always inspie in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .
	1.2462870176035135
" how good it was in you , my dear mr bennet !
	1.5748229028373526
good heaven !
	7.2547406442545945
i am perfectly satisfied .
	3.369023273038461
mr collins then returned to elizabeth .
	2.258535586382407
not handsome enough to dance with !
	2.352683804018557
now be sincere ; did you admieme for my impertiece ? "
	1.5468480655496
is not this an agreeable surprie "
	2.279918285944347
bingley was sure of being lie wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .
	1.415068781988354
she dared not even mention that gentleman .
	2.023101164588643
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .
	1.3927520770950141
" you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smie and are provoking me to it every moment . "
	1.2021207896870165
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .
	1.281807562966565
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guie that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .
	1.217553017970824
it is highly improper .
	3.136733225197793
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " - and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?
	1.3020571983034357
it was gratifying to have inspie unconsciously so strong an affection .
	1.5883204703758544
lady catherierose also , and they turned back .
	1.8971896810882891
but now it was all too natural .
	2.009842965170195
the dejection was almost uniesal .
	2.550844422245869
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .
	1.2105020761445924
your ie of the ponies is delightful .
	2.014626250597746
when lady catherieand her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mr collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .
	1.1922505970524186
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .
	1.5668906416699768
" do you not think it would be a proper compliet to the place ? "
	1.3798706947878823
chapter xii
	15.402741744352168
not that i am afraid of _myself_ , but i dread other people ' s remarks . "
	1.3318315353366927
" i did not think you would ; - and that being the case , i cannot consie your situation with much compassion . "
	1.231143480197489
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .
	1.6327625959526448
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn .
	1.2548881491048616
what is your own opinion ? "
	2.1008973657352104
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .
	1.3341624464464716
their reception from mr bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .
	1.3534224650405908
why does she not come in ? "
	1.9248528120946629
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
	1.5428144928032983
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again .
	1.4798129882451214
" this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth .
	1.3515776799008026
said she , as she looked in her face .
	1.7341891811826717
lydia , my love , ring the bell .
	1.9025368754190204
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was . "
	1.3521287406600007
my dear charlotte , - impossible ! "
	1.9810754667256594
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr
	1.6979471964256998
the day passed much as the day before had done .
	1.6535202709622072
but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king .
	1.3712632241277374
" a man in distressed circumstances has not tiefor all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .
	1.352074910518586
- " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever siet on this point .
	1.2924789164955948
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .
	2.028411873731543
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .
	1.2675821256179078
promieme , therefore , to come to hunsford . "
	1.6776706420787917
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses .
	1.500062491180914
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlie_them_ .
	1.542665390076477
elizabeth receie her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .
	1.202588999428512
they had long wished to see him .
	1.9852167236158622
jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to elizabeth .
	1.459944224869583
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "
	1.1826031642345218
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .
	1.2418199841989228
sometie one offie , sometie another had been her favourie as their attentions raie them in her opinion .
	1.327400110202801
mr darcy has not authorie me to make his communication public .
	1.5784009995848172
when i went away , i am sure i had no more ie of being married till i came back again !
	1.3172729615087662
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "
	1.29572326299303
they are wanted in the farm , mr bennet , are not they ? "
	1.4199234432842514
i am very , very sorry .
	2.2597259247864256
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "
	1.4144422566267023
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .
	1.4384197323823096
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . "
	1.170562665148376
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
	1.2813551031170678
not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain - but then she is our particular friend . "
	1.332490338284882
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had receie , must make _her_ feel the oblie .
	1.189679993618524
so much the better .
	3.102344870386418
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . - your ' s , & c . " e
	1.2560428998479833
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ . "
	1.679456946993575
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .
	1.450063964697599
mr collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could gielittle fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .
	1.1792681357018424
" perhaps we might be deceie . "
	1.9081581638738117
so much the man of fashion !
	2.397987180660974
mr bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admie by the netherfield party .
	1.4689138215107853
i quiedetest the man . "
	2.374939783321983
but do not deceieyourself into a belief that i will ever recede .
	1.546140293200847
it was more than civil ; it was really attentie and there was no necessity for such attention .
	1.3415270473121546
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his sieeven more .
	1.4198174255685316
you are a great deal too apt you know , to liepeople in general .
	1.4790343496988665
this he consieed sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .
	1.2652013447554658
" this is not to be borne .
	2.0211034434696677
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "
	1.1876200485194022
they contaie no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .
	1.2812772023894572
jane was not deceie , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .
	1.1785563831572843
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do , when i tell you all . "
	1.2944534674615067
how was that possible ?
	3.4417634997449915
' lady catherie ' said she , ' you have gie me a treasure . '
	1.416995442145228
it is mr bingley i am sure .
	2.0305820347625056
her carriage remaie at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it .
	1.3565824692492034
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !
	1.4196145757831922
mr gardie added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .
	1.2492682980999734
mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .
	1.529953559413534
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .
	1.414623966367452
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .
	1.6242413535028701
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .
	1.2445687083728152
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .
	1.286189486483812
the first tieof my ever seeing him in hertfordshie you must know , was at a ball - and at this ball , what do you think he did ?
	1.225690172802723
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .
	1.3239052013252928
" i do not believe that he will ever lieat netherfield any more . "
	1.405032867101871
and will you gieyourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information .
	1.2135080031235694
respect , esteem , and confiece , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happies were overthrown .
	1.2807999320532857
charlotte says , she hardly ever does .
	2.08968188494518
in spieof this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .
	1.1824295760888535
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object .
	1.5415638347600102
she wished to discredit it entiey , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false !
	1.4779622446352485
mr bennet was privieed to whisper it to mr philips , and _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .
	1.1943764148910012
chapter iv
	15.402741744352168
i feel as if i had never done you justie or loved you as you deserve . "
	1.3315251104113597
mr bennet , in equal siece , was enjoying the scene .
	1.5677994913537683
yes . - do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley .
	1.3007726060151041
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .
	1.2793142177184653
collins . "
	5.88601776996019
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every fieminutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .
	1.2247204264775842
the path just admitted three .
	2.5386987312287053
was it merely to rieto longbourn and be embarrassed ?
	1.8555533459753324
" i do , i do liehim , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him .
	1.271360980837456
" in marrying your nephew , i should not consie myself as quitting that sphere .
	1.4288333234551722
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . "
	1.4477370595671883
" did it , " said he , " did it _soon_ make you think better of me ?
	1.3748676377103606
at night she opened her heart to jane .
	1.8643360114149539
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr bingley will lieit lizzy . "
	1.2189917300710604
have you never happened to see her there ? "
	1.672359474069041
those were your words .
	3.22223487907913
" she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley .
	1.5440859812068084
but i must wrieno more .
	2.650510536949356
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ?
	1.2841095795141289
cried jane .
	7.105638332567009
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "
	1.2792088608850911
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .
	1.3777156597460816
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .
	1.3573957262043854
[ illustration : morning drss .
	2.5567629240640026
but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .
	1.2821584089849938
in anticipating the happies of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .
	1.2094417530761425
" i _have_ heard from authority , which i thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "
	1.1815271240068117
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evietly and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .
	1.2275936356952386
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .
	1.2818618430547937
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .
	1.2314700639745695
if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud . "
	1.3785511684835037
" nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth .
	1.4308042282068247
" that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .
	1.530749981329595
he repeated the question , with some surprieat her siece .
	1.6532708100728208
i should infiniey prefer a book . "
	1.9225095319730359
it is useless to talk of it . "
	1.7840772368663127
my brother and the gentlemen are to diewith the offies .
	1.6622786025254532
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .
	1.4877577691967596
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more tiebefore he wrote .
	1.4546508267481169
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .
	1.2396612633294481
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure .
	1.461570135543131
_she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .
	1.2567129709205163
never in her liehad she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .
	1.2588322246530659
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smie she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way . "
	1.2209387592569123
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .
	1.2634390289002682
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .
	1.44561342043368
mr darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .
	1.456806364488977
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .
	1.2248668908462643
how are you all ? "
	2.3983903525437156
you know not what you are about . "
	1.7761524559733812
i was uncomfortable enough .
	3.164916269149607
" can you deny that you have done it ? "
	1.6022846786006981
" i am no longer surprie at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women .
	1.4809852268990091
i wish you had been there .
	2.251080078402893
perhaps i am not doing her justie
	2.2159104555668256
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .
	1.5854713401578937
i can hardly wriefor laughing .
	2.609781570353709
that he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .
	1.436434793260535
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
	1.4875702743287937
" i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " _i_ can hardly be just to him . "
	1.2376257171899074
but of this answer lydia heard not a word .
	1.7233734305152089
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked .
	1.6710847188325262
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .
	1.2485237565628682
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival .
	1.4545206076147783
i knew how it would be .
	2.286897866996567
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .
	1.5641335735909279
" there is nothing the matter with me .
	1.844237088265874
" yes , and i had heard it before .
	1.7575595160212156
" at once to insist upon having such a report uniesally contradicted . "
	1.455171502975766
to carolies assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .
	1.3653570288340307
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of fieand twenty .
	1.5140823064800903
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her .
	1.3905469739506722
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudie i had been encouraging .
	1.297917983982729
mr darcy , you cannot deny the fact . "
	1.6850854637549273
" i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly .
	1.520536964833163
is not it so , mr
	3.136351959171675
" yes , very well .
	2.5931723415176795
well , any friend of mr bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . "
	1.1688452219319605
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .
	1.1801890577337972
till this moment , i never knew myself . "
	1.674309397851353
how rejoie was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !
	1.4031778312604826
they battled it together for a long tie which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .
	1.2834771931021145
we had better go into the avenue . "
	1.779434935231085
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without briey and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .
	1.2279244341566231
the general prejudieagainst mr darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .
	1.1777591724946985
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her lie "
	1.305733720984198
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .
	1.6566812041934482
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .
	1.2817431847246514
women fancy admiration means more than it does . "
	1.6779562287526952
the happiest , wiet , most reasonable end ! "
	1.7189763784397565
lydia ' s voiewas heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .
	1.2753958829544516
" nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .
	1.2117841318468865
i dearly love a laugh . "
	2.091566270126995
" he lie to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam .
	1.4103962539503117
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .
	1.2054116026507238
certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .
	1.2243035860259026
" what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?
	1.5539937093223843
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .
	1.6631507038633608
whiethese newly born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing .
	1.2889372665908507
i never meant to deceieyou , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .
	1.4477030623334188
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in siece ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .
	1.1755847033661573
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . "
	1.3545117589886246
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .
	1.2307257037366053
" your ' s sincerely , & c . " miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .
	1.189714083044272
dear me !
	7.147574255486928
their fortune on both sie is splendid .
	2.024525685535296
" do you consie the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?
	1.3541804126467454
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .
	1.335149676627204
" lizzy , " said her father , " i have gie him my consent .
	1.40430684864613
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .
	1.2295088264888754
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .
	1.7491523562413125
" i do not get on at all .
	1.8939075257960467
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do !
	1.5488157668115423
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !
	1.4817043981544091
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say .
	1.2841521255414183
they then went away .
	3.0253926731118197
why any fear of detection ?
	2.8654902385877756
a great deal more passed at the other table .
	1.721457354531441
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .
	1.2881925452833562
" impossible , mr bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? "
	1.233002992947915
this preservatieshe had now obtaie ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .
	1.2112580839858638
she now lost every expectation of pleasure .
	1.993838050994823
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .
	1.2065320834298925
it gie me pain to speak ill of a darcy .
	1.6519000202085246
the particulars , i reserve till we meet .
	1.8795109917837813
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?
	1.6059230037191414
" i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .
	1.1809784219241422
" if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think . "
	1.2509940069100225
cried miss bingley .
	4.213855228016324
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .
	1.183097640179098
" he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lie .
	1.318436745818482
and one of my own daughters .
	2.2811365975109643
and so , is it quiecertain he is coming ? "
	1.6052891321684322
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease . "
	1.2651255082931947
the busies was therefore soon settled .
	2.2726559322298905
good girl !
	7.295986655823937
he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his siece ; but it had not been so in derbyshie
	1.2611265172404713
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did .
	1.4311582740896216
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .
	1.2992482989957455
chapter xiii
	15.402741744352168
if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .
	1.2390322217100773
they will ruin your happies .
	2.5869002154874337
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catheriede bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "
	1.1817356513549393
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way .
	1.3941971095102084
mr gardie left them soon after breakfast .
	2.029514557135004
can i speak plaie ?
	3.4607419089736284
" i dislieit very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . "
	1.3340839308209627
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .
	1.5352647747987436
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happies which she might in future be able to dispense .
	1.2554393831447017
" are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagiethat you are gratifying mie "
	1.3360951745137073
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .
	1.1749224067163493
but slyness seems the fashion .
	2.547527216646433
he placed himself by her .
	2.623600325587185
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out .
	1.5200174251337846
the children have been wanting me this half hour .
	1.7566883365269084
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
	1.1822751431284078
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth !
	1.255673017610635
elizabeth felt that they had entiey mistaken his character , but said nothing .
	1.5015645124928596
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .
	1.2552050373809078
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better .
	1.3726436519167433
he has gie in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceie us .
	1.3587027192904606
at fieo ' clock the two ladies retie to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner .
	1.3002498703492629
" not so hasty , if you please .
	1.9558762250380235
your ' s , very sincerely , " m
	1.931930158943452
" i had not at that tiethe honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "
	1.2770100215041893
how is such a man to be worked on ?
	1.8562688259243298
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .
	1.655559065328136

" i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "

	3.7509410881833913
" lady catherie i have nothing farther to say .
	1.7683870068655356
elizabeth had scarcely tieto disclaim all right to the compliet , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .
	1.1894015234945934
i am confiet that she would have performed delightfully .
	1.7623762181060558
he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !
	1.5089293110951203
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertiet myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . "
	1.2112104563731514
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is lieor not . "
	1.411856387641251
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .
	1.285467946489933
this cannot be !
	4.5471122337489
how mr darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .
	1.5914570360015916
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "
	1.8003990618378256
" certainly , sir ; - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world . - every savage can dance . "
	1.175142525381424
" this is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gie such an elegance to misfortune !
	1.2895841704098163
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .
	1.386881569446379
" did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "
	1.1711563111820806
mr hill began instantly to express her joy .
	1.8584251667696334
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight .
	1.3459493081258669
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "
	1.3526835179510315
" and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me !
	1.2713384808420534
it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . "
	1.4075169456316232
every time they met , it was more decie and remarkable .
	1.602709256359322
no offie is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .
	1.3517035445493857
he was very fond of them . "
	1.9121383800890732
what is to become of us !
	2.3660777872562537
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "
	1.3123082097852827
mr bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton .

" you are too hasty , sir , " she cried .
	1.6443826186365769
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion .
	1.3020048584395685
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered .
	1.6381315908265823
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases . "
	1.7931706333193687
" the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes - does it ? "
	1.4498849311216915
my dear , " said maria quieshocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherie
	1.3830048863140891
but it is very liey that he _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "
	1.1952546272234899
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "
	1.361537116471621
" dearest jane !
	4.426864992230095
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometie spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too freely .
	1.237767884652979
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .
	1.629861578009799
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ?
	1.6013851368640464
this room was my late master ' s favourieroom , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .
	1.2810324273638483
" and what am i to do on the occasion ? - it seems an hopeless busies . "
	1.309352132367678
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you .
	1.3696033443050242
every body was surprie ; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned sietly away .
	1.313977472880773
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house .
	1.5960944993680937
his understanding and temper , though unlieher own , would have answered all her wishes .
	1.4150840544448169
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own miey was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family .
	1.1775351979525177
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to gieher every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done !
	1.2026044622155492
darcy_ , you see , is the man !
	1.9913905955808937
" i will not be interrupted .
	2.263820637554172
" we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth .
	1.3309689140281342
though her manner varied however , her determination never did .
	1.6502782348108596
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .
	1.7217415381129924
she is a very great favouriewith some ladies of my acquaintance , mr hurst and miss bingley .
	1.3617926973455492
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other .
	1.5860331474084308
replied kitty , " it looks just liethat man that used to be with him before .
	1.3818566699618737
there is not a fie county in england than derbyshie "
	1.7344874203968181
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? "
	1.4561167983428218
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her .
	1.673567829874339
" have you any ie , lizzy , who this gentleman is ?
	1.6122693486291007
ten thousand a year , and very liey more !
	1.8409151105012125
lady catherieit appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy .
	1.211765471591088
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .
	1.4121076582478407
but my dear lydia , i do not at all lieyour going such a way off .
	1.3777147487328711
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
	1.1908365295047945
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwiethan by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .
	1.27260978146601
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .
	1.1992153169282784
fiethousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mr bennet and the children .
	1.4944546198087798
but you are always giving _her_ the preference . "
	1.6795988603543135
at that moment , she cared for no other .
	1.7251410119173454

affectation of candour is common enough ; - one meets it every where .
	1.5128311215901107
" gracechurch street , monday , august <NUMBER> .
	1.875667043845848
what does he say ?
	3.5778695326109373
" so , lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find .
	1.3030770030586347
the foundation ' s ein or federal tax ietification number is <NUMBER> - 621541 .
	1.4609778693810762
i am the happiest creature in the world .
	1.8684243260872566
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and wrieof it without material pain .
	1.311297234971835
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .
	1.232080735347641
" is this , " thought elizabeth , " meant for me ? "
	1.456730328763604
a few days after this visit , mr bingley called again , and alone .
	1.499132550154992
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly siet ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "
	1.173324201632028
but he is an ugly fellow !
	2.3818930046258755
it would be dreadful !
	3.366234367122951
" what is mr darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ?
	1.401797734373234
and what do you think she said besie ?
	1.9576157756710066
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwiethan decline them . "
	1.2424733120487128
elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .
	1.3194438918148188
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came dietly towards them , and began the usual civilities .
	1.2882089192957755
many small donations ( $ 1 to $ 5 , 0 ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs
	1.2782443754991963
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .
	1.3898361141962208
" i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , " for a kingdom !
	1.3577479504476317
but i have other provocations .
	2.609205354349765
but she had no reason to fear mr and mr gardie ' s curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .
	1.2454562741853088
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very liey hopes of mr bingley ' s heart were entertaie .
	1.2228849726195095
as for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful siece .
	1.1746698184455633
i shall never forget her appearance this morning .
	1.804225165783468
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth receie from lydia on her marriage , explaie to her that , by his wieat least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .
	1.182698734098603
they called at various tie of the morning , sometie separately , sometie together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .
	1.2578716333726037
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
" yes , sir ; but i do not know when _that_ will be .
	1.454178661842506
was not this some excuse for incivility , if i _was_ uncivil ?
	1.6132433971870663
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .
	1.824083069662269
at that moment they were met from another walk , by mr hurst and elizabeth herself .
	1.3863880106390476
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "
	1.678139585859997
you are determie to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
	1.240611075379271
chapter xx
	15.402741744352168
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria .
	1.5899313034145026
but so they always are .
	2.623041344574697
her performance on the piano forte is exquisie "
	2.1444851771902003
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .
	1.5290991390947442
" oh ! "
	4.022789383027674
but jane could think with certainty on only one point , - that mr bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .
	1.1723577234934826
on sunday , after morning servie the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .
	1.373147598901013
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelliet young woman , about twenty seven , was elizabeth ' s intimate friend .
	1.2687411587862376
not liethe wild young men now a - days , who think of nothing but themselves .
	1.381762953973375
now is your tie
	5.9889938652959005
elizabeth was distressed .
	4.044792861607095
such were the gentle murmurs of mr bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley ' s continued absence .
	1.2381986293124538
oh !
	18.52144218810643
so , he enquie who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .
	1.3238951674497514
they were natural and just .
	2.6077592160154444
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .
	1.3100488224872455
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .
	1.3158421124852597
" upon my word , carolie i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation . "
	1.2667633355734853
a thousand things may ariein six months ! "
	1.8341833027073164
" very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say .
	1.523387352086776
i shall lieit of all things .
	2.235802783186689
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth !
	1.4566838097538999
he had ruie for a whieevery hope of happies for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .
	1.1794810470000592
" can you come to morrow ? "
	1.9092533619140388
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate siece .
	1.2814351634486507
what pin money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !
	1.603195604229955
[ illustration : a vicarage house ]
	2.2168228027712
under such circumstances , however , he was not liey to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .
	1.321966153641201
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .
	1.6047716670613177
oh !
	18.52144218810643
said jane . - " i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her . "
	1.410979742867841
lady catheriewas generally speaking - stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .
	1.3199941179453438
<NUMBER> . f4 .
	4.228503689896403
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unliey they should have opposed their brother ' s .
	1.2963144238156508
" it ought to be so ; it must be so , whiehe retains the use of his reason .
	1.3089919560440184
she answered him with cold civility .
	2.2860995418850676
and so did mr forster .
	2.693537770225319
mr bennet , who fancied she had gaie a complete victory over him , continued her triumph .
	1.3879207807010543
" yes ; and they have another , who lie somewhere near cheapsie "
	1.5892826105158568
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very liey on wednesday .
	1.4949930172454917
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
	1.4329271453945691
ring the bell , kitty , for hill .
	1.924085837318719
such a charming man ! - so handsome !
	1.9842993026037707
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london . "
	1.3787047459336206
" you may well warn me against such an evil .
	1.6469782301462719
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .
	1.4494829651278847
the period of expectation was now doubled .
	2.001452247538393
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money . "
	1.3814000030973135
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty ; " who can it be ? "
	1.2843249327604873
" is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? "
	1.2546577406650763
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when he put his letter into her hand !
	1.2711771162516277
it only shews her being deficient in something herself - sense or feeling . "
	1.4110031900412578
" my dear , " replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request .
	1.357833311758481
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .
	1.2976806803792154
she complaie bitterly of all this to her husband .
	1.7286575973665659
" i do not know .
	2.6728840110252072
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .
	1.5346084235353779
i am impatient to see him . "
	1.901716585624127
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character . "
	1.226313342628338
said he , with a look of doubt .
	1.8473357710671605
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .
	1.5955601588361294
" for the lieies of your mind , i did . "
	1.5433737775133507
dear lizzy , only consie what he must have suffered .
	1.6721894277851732
" as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smie " very true , it will be wiein me to refrain from _that_ .
	1.207149737680965
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .
	1.4022874038970667
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company .
	1.6614317222459032
nothing could console and nothing appease her . - nor did that day wear out her resentment .
	1.3585029027780449
in a few minutes she was joie by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .
	1.2676551137762515
mr bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast .
	1.362663202802805
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .
	1.6518668866091653
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth - and it was soon done - done whiemr bennet was stirring the fie
	1.2724326725024362
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .
	1.328307352747624
the loss of her daughter made mr bennet very dull for several days .
	1.477882859547826
cried maria , after a few minutes siece , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! - and yet how many things have happened ! "
	1.1828563231089562
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
	1.4396918786163424
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diliece and care .
	1.207966661263523
" much more rational , my dear carolie i dare say , but it would not be near so much liea ball . "
	1.237620963598054
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
what are you telling miss bennet ?
	2.432151579207392
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips .
	1.198711587826128
he has not an ill natured look .
	1.9813511922708071
elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal . "
	1.4095062255143342
could you expect me to rejoiein the inferiority of your connections ?
	1.7037248027100926
she was therefore oblie to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr darcy .
	1.1964228480578658
" you can _now_ have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered .
	1.4613595310492977
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lie .
	1.5265899483727994
elizabeth could bear it no longer .
	2.184882887421767
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negliet and dilatory correspondent , but at such a tie they had hoped for exertion .
	1.219854992215584
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . "
	1.358842080538071
" your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , " has too much truth .
	1.31738427747497
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient .
	1.4866503466830792
i never was .
	4.471788686317298
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .
	1.4602500697584022
when mr bennet arrie , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .
	1.422681329538779
" my motiefor cautioning you , is as follows .
	1.7780752501964594
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliet of the highest kind .
	1.390242121387694
" they have both , " said she , " been deceie , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no ie .
	1.1945377056616429
i _will_ leave him to himself . "
	1.9104929912150097
it was then disclosed in the following manner .
	1.8383589438569032
and though he exclaie at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .
	1.3302600342980557
" that is very strange .
	2.561403925628326
" i must not decieon my own performance . "
	1.6789044498119665
what is it you are talking of ?
	2.178809968366742
mr bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued siet till they reached the house .
	1.2712620852775967
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , mr bennet sat quiestill , and unable to utter a syllable .
	1.2570921568216222
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "
	1.4074193549026206
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence . "
	1.3587716226641613
but you would not wish to be dancing whieshe is ill . " lydia declared herself satisfied .
	1.374933400359163
i would advieyou merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .
	1.2407725052629046
he was siet .
	4.135966120817805
" nearly three weeks . "
	2.4176634024454295
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you lieof me . "
	1.1700961594557178
he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . "
	1.3735486132414674
we dieat rosings twieevery week , and are never allowed to walk home .
	1.486794777304569
" i am sick of mr bingley , " cried his wie
	1.5774424886223843
with what delighted prieshe afterwards visie mr bingley and talked of mr darcy may be guessed .
	1.3824531957082542
from what i can collect , he left derbyshieonly one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .
	1.232592062221351
it is nearly fifty mie . "
	2.0951380603192904
" miss bennet i am shocked and astonished .
	1.9065959207939376
iii
	334.7971469297504
as she pronounced these words , mr darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her whieshe continued .
	1.2155223574523841
" you are uniformly charming ! "
	2.1679372853329
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add .
	1.419953626428902
mr wickham ' s society was of material serviein dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family .
	1.223273029665028
they had frequently been staying with her in town .
	1.748397151274468
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_ .
	1.4879043843157316
she comes to us to day .
	2.2271267977366023
" shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "

international donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations receie from outsiethe unie sttes .
	1.267269457258446
it had better have happened to _you_ , lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .
	1.321442801053489
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wieevery day . "
	1.3593495112956493
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .
	1.4187296419052524
assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable .
	2.090944028145228
i came to try you .
	2.5821820522170222
" _you_ began the evening well , charlotte , " said mr bennet with civil self command to miss lucas .
	1.299461887677174
said elizabeth .
	7.171353744561802
jane was not happy .
	3.2201366808674585
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he lie it .
	1.3694061662372865
" speak to lizzy about it yourself .
	1.9907366547872123
mr
	1064.435926386322
the tête - à - tête surprie them .
	1.848927523006055
lady catherie i believe , did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford . "
	1.291968541160636
" yes - the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .
	1.3136883993217987
" he is also handsome , " replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought lieieto be , if he possibly can .
	1.2675790930392647
mr
	1064.435926386322
" i shall be very fit to see jane - which is all i want . "
	1.3578883234901167
he owns it himself without disguie "
	2.676849953887214
his wierepresented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield .
	1.2569430140043318
she shook her head .
	3.244473796559681
chapter viii
	15.402741744352168
if i could but see _you_ as happy !
	1.9943266807210647
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter .
	1.6405954323495888
jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "
	1.186697863677599
but i dare not hope it .
	2.279720159717475
mr gardie expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .
	1.2920647935807406
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems liey to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "
	1.1939512990513943
this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wieand fiedaughters at once .
	1.2834999565134966
she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .
	1.4892086708239214
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north .
	1.1917248562374176
mr jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .
	1.2178616457188383
miss bennet eagerly disclaie all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praieon her sister ' s warm affection .
	1.3264382742377734
mr bingley had danced with her twie and she had been distinguished by his sisters .
	1.404421744600799
" some tieor other he _will_ be - but it shall not be by _me_ .
	1.4170169564364439
pemberley was now georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see .
	1.2678212378769098
i had not believed it possible . "
	1.9081478373400107
elizabeth smie .
	7.246581892284741
perhaps he thought her too young .
	2.2141922328667394
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .
	1.2758751583281405
lord !
	22.050770791821073
darcy said very little , and mr hurst nothing at all .
	1.6046310146375253
no sentiet of shame gave a damp to her triumph .
	1.6887226799740618
" upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .
	1.2714127085110338
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .
	1.194827530894061
the other is miss de bourgh .
	2.260799621545317
he had never had the slightest suspicion .
	2.0261302313521075
he was quieyoung , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .
	1.2062560759621033
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .
	1.180529607286701
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . "
	1.5447578212884283
he now wished it more than ever .
	1.9919481887063166
kitty simpered and smie , and hoped her turn was coming soon .
	1.5080026092330017
" i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .

lady catheriede bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consieation for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .
	1.3271555037926703
" he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only . "
	1.1628177769784542
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement .
	1.2199078875804144
had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and _would_ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .
	1.2040829171218248
" _her_ not objecting , does not justify _him_ .
	1.7612552192751785
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from carolie
	1.4481484074910886
" he is perfectly well behaved , polie and unassuming , " said her uncle .
	1.412727938110256
she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .
	1.235816503294515
" you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , " that mr bingley did not do justieto his own disposition .
	1.2582790632532648
they walked on , without knowing in what dietion .
	1.7523556359659043
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .
	1.479807805979098
has she any family ? "
	2.4210750560504675
could there be fie symptoms ?
	2.81814567934927
but you do not know _all_ .
	2.2681173040754334
mr darcy is engaged to _my daughter_ .
	2.0274624955234968
he seldom appeared really animated .
	2.5906164879118734
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "
	1.4045699254562618
" good heaven !
	4.4540276804435655
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . "
	1.4437099095032409
she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .
	1.2284059103286682
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much .
	1.659105134891976
not these two or three years perhaps . "
	1.7856367930832062
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . "
	1.4858140106480788
she then proceeded to enquieinto the measures which her father had intended to pursue , whiein town , for the recovery of his daughter .
	1.2427074880757778
" i do not mind his not talking to mr long , " said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza . "
	1.2011779986965703
said her aunt .
	4.1754060471283605
" i have already told her so once , by your desie "
	1.675282445211993
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her siea _scheme_ of infamy .
	1.3621946570268952
he even looked at her with a smieof affected incredulity .
	1.6611504295398456
it was to be such a secret ! "
	1.8250223317320824
her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! "
	1.8534808534725504
you promie me to _insist_ upon her marrying him . "
	1.5981907828669115
he came , and in such very good tie that the ladies were none of them dressed .
	1.3643595962147494
younger sons cannot marry where they lie "
	2.3020510661964635
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .
	1.6758974780231226
not yet , however , in spieof her disappointment in her husband , did mr bennet gieup the point .
	1.3100317574519829
" i am sure there is not on _his_ .
	1.7414634969636995
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most .
	1.3948186047225968
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .
	1.2497558635592698
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well .
	1.4783732251993729
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catheriewould not come in again and rest herself .
	1.2372946394455746
" thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .
	1.4479110814877
that tall , proud man . "
	2.099117712013505
i expected you to stay two months .
	2.0434387742976763
it was a rational scheme to be sure !
	1.9652868843154487
what can he mean by being so tieome as to be always coming here ?
	1.5017075752258244
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .
	1.3140919637712516
after sitting for a moment in siece , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet .
	1.2592616270564865
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane .
	1.6594802163180602
his doing so drew her notie
	2.5298348670265454
" i never heard that it was . "
	1.772393977655111
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examie , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility . "
	1.1886591295132862
do not let us quarrel about the past .
	1.8897268006079453
your mother must have been quiea slave to your education . "
	1.5386382037476731
darcy ! "
	6.461054306545702
he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .
	1.3811859892486567
it is really too distressing .
	2.58755962967065
" i cannot gieyou credit for any philosophy of the kind .
	1.592633224065027
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .
	1.8254879359085225
elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .
	1.3739782757288315
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .
	1.4660994452158234
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceie independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . "
	1.263576661471204
their mutual affection will steady them ; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and liein so rational a manner , as may in tiemake their past imprudence forgotten . "
	1.1664448107492966
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? "
	1.2212909883568697
" about a month ago i receie this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .
	1.1801145650986384
" but if you have got them to day , " said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . "
	1.229616705209782
i will not tell you what it is .
	1.900925231074374
lady catheriehesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .
	1.3054469173157646
" i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth ; " but i do not particularly lieyour way of getting husbands . "
	1.2059392794252966
" do you talk by rule then , whieyou are dancing ? "
	1.4926062399203535
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positieengagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon .
	1.238480147861933
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .
	1.3341677755632209
but who was your mother ?
	2.8088294026285676
" i am not one and twenty . "
	1.7675550943754423
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding mr bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .
	1.1839565214093128
chapter xvi
	15.402741744352168
is she handsome ? "
	2.8808330225931864
i know we diewith four and twenty families . "
	1.6793433995937093
do not distress me by the ie .
	2.0177061308856215
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .
	1.4115766971376094
after pausing on this point a consieable whie she once more continued to read .
	1.4648161666907984
" ' tis too much ! "
	2.1785171160818853
it is every way horrible ! "
	2.1792004433240892
mr long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . "
	1.2545199762195705
mr jones says we must not think of moving her .
	1.6630940321348644
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
" but i would really advieyou to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model .
	1.2774814364621765
but will they make you happy ? "
	1.9313830552869042
i depend on you for that . "
	1.9151601767755169
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .
	1.1960626042531308
chapter vi
	15.402741744352168
" they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determie "
	1.3991793771697807
chapter iii
	15.402741744352168
i have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims .
	1.4848221672286934
" this is wholly unexpected .
	2.692913745962613
she finds miss pope a treasure .
	2.2367225220248783
" i am grieved , indeed , " cried darcy ; " grieved - shocked .
	1.4481243144471423
teazing , teazing , man !
	2.7643854723616617
" nothing child , nothing .
	2.726569056750467
mr bennet ' s expectations were fully answered .
	1.8670249784292567
mr hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evietly impatient to have the house to themselves .
	1.2391510119090172
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .
	1.305944589384466
in talking over their route the evening before , mr gardie expressed an inclination to see the place again .
	1.3080419912959973
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smie and tears .
	1.302331136702015
why must _she_ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?
	1.492689188359064
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notie
	1.5830512566158566
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mr bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
	1.291374487884897
i do not believe she often sees such at home . "
	1.5358993550705695
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was oblie to walk about the room , whieelizabeth tried to uniecivility and truth in a few short sentences .
	1.1860419725154026
" neglect !
	7.594626503589724
_you_ may ask questions , which _i_ shall not choose to answer . "
	1.443039922896433
" _you_ go to brighton ! - i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds !

we must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "
	1.6039728463203666
mr gardie about this tiereminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and requie information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather giecontentment to her aunt than to herself .
	1.1734180260656397
darcy ? "
	5.8344050411895
elizabeth read on ; " i have seen them both .
	1.6555022898612386
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "
	1.2966136592407456
very well .
	6.8704662235012535
their visits to mr philips were now productieof the most interesting intelliece .
	1.5473646988705356
" lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?
	1.6012427620838368
her answer was warmly in his favour .
	2.0258796738335927
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspie can never take place .
	1.4039342109341097
but i must tell you how it went off .
	1.7363887399691105
but it is all , all too late now . "
	1.5922935682944384
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs , i cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mie
	1.2274014425571722
" true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .
	1.4665150777421847
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
i have no such injuries to resent .
	2.0325359204461333
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .
	1.4211317315466339
darcy said nothing at all .
	2.607545448681872
" when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other . "
	1.2114001087766
" how i long to see her again !
	1.9578832908182575
" but i hope you will get over it , and lieto see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "
	1.2095649420412218
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
	1.250620505952511
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ies between us .
	1.4133213119675805
mr what ' s his name .
	2.2417465490420794
mr reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room .
	1.3979813759055064
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman liemanner . '
	1.2787611537939152
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .
	1.585515818833976
amongst the most violent against him was mr bennet , whose dislieof his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .
	1.1973789683907168
cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .
	1.6420943021216483
" if we thought alieof miss bingley , " replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quieeasy .
	1.2658606311910034
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquie of every body too , who is liey to know . "
	1.186808104079237
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .
	1.5194479020386997
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "
	1.4986373635741972
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .
	1.2578933227687283
since her father ' s death , her home has been london , where a lady lie with her , and superintends her education . "
	1.220935097448413
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fieclothes and fiecarriages than jane .
	1.339394953163005
young ladies of her age , are sometie a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may lieto have her own way . "
	1.1742982243997384
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either sie "
	1.2709497451719722
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mr bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .
	1.2815550756109253
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day . "
	1.2267802703718875
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .
	1.2429469391859778
what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "
	1.4712991274669698
" at four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said mr bennet , as he folded up the letter .
	1.206671644777686
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .
	1.6254661235896417
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .
	1.4615500464641349
mr bennet invie him to diewith them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .
	1.2893055092593235
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !
	1.6012321556909543
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was siet .
	1.3324558580088997
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "
	1.48858546663696
" are you quiesure , ma ' am ? - is not there a little mistake ? "
	1.3334761232062307
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all liey to make her more elegant .
	1.2758733251576235
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten mie off ! "
	1.3298135134582347
wickham will never marry a woman without some money .
	1.7681927639121702
but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .
	1.2583235196499676
she cried .
	7.773305354536543
" oh , well !
	3.412819477011801
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
	1.2288260416552468
mr bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr collins began .
	1.356431472482867
" undoubtedly .
	7.388559574696621
the busies of her liewas to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .
	1.3551553683612367
said elizabeth .
	7.171353744561802
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?
	1.7561439639160308
miss bingley ' s letter arrie , and put an end to doubt .
	1.4833470085351002
lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !
	1.4365801579950253
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .
	1.7466322533587684
fiedaughters brought up at home without a governess ! - i never heard of such a thing .
	1.3490608368785968
" but there seems indelicacy in dieting his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . "
	1.3144463072728851
her ladyship seemed pleased with the ie , and you may imagiethat i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliets which are always acceptable to ladies .
	1.1962570061702145
- it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
	1.4741338079986495
" perhaps i do .
	3.609325241179588
" she did indeed , louisa .
	2.329965668591723
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came .
	1.2861805764419778
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .
	1.2112151535895286
he cannot afford it .
	3.1064927492974523
vol
	334.7971469297504
but i knew not - i was afraid of doing too much .
	1.5477130776933805
she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .
	1.2254461865898802
will you come and see me ? "
	1.9195103001743388
_that_ is all settled . "
	2.387014566547686
gardiner "
	45.441445608712115
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
" you are then resolved to have him ? "
	1.6820366926380153
three daughters married !
	4.531905212416142
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelliece .
	1.3868629859280808
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? "
	1.5498277324515608
she was ashamed to think how much .
	2.00910707738482
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay .
	1.5010966497067482
your uncle is as much surprie as i am - and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .
	1.178622454179683
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .
	1.4461332099235291
its busies offieis located at <NUMBER> north <NUMBER> west , salt lake city , ut <NUMBER> , ( 801 ) <NUMBER> - 187 .
	1.2634794121485782
" she will drop the acquaintance entiey . "
	1.786125710239112
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ?
	1.658226149246466
mr philips visie them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .
	1.3450020948447705
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their _three_ months ' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ .
	1.19132643140942
i am sick of them all .
	2.2552246864338685
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .
	2.038893505444892
good bye .
	6.915320874886606
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .
	1.2082836981914002
and there are several of the young men , too , that she lie very much .
	1.3883411674312933
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "
	1.2191794916593546
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .
	1.3918664263070384
my friend has an excellent understanding - though i am not certain that i consie her marrying mr collins as the wiet thing she ever did .
	1.2279918625640551
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "
	1.3011242761283406
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister .
	1.2226532677412727
" how could you begin ? "
	2.113287754203499
he has been accused of many faults at different tie ; but _this_ is the true one .
	1.3599634892728478
i am ashamed of you !
	2.7337437826607016
" indeed i had .
	3.629832446203036
" could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his wie "
	1.4363346963931352
to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .
	1.2638501787771241
you know i have .
	3.455634256085843

	1.8504398697254103
yours ever , " caroline bingley "
	2.28672395744283
single , my dear , to be sure !
	1.9504043958845996
but the case is this .
	2.6407599978128498
" she is so fond of mr forster , " said she , " it will be quieshocking to send her away !
	1.3005153821897346
<NUMBER> . e
	6.564352859725503
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defie .
	1.6436810836800615
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself .
	1.175614738375665
" well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?
	1.2888310663479443
the reason of this sudden removal was soon eviet .
	1.748039119537241
mr bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , receie her with the utmost polieess .
	1.2618246230091918
she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . "
	1.2943226401385137
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprie and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mr bennet ' s civilities .
	1.1744175529850962
cried elizabeth when she had finished it .
	2.022810188048759
" certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .
	1.1989537866570972
but no such recollection befriended her .
	2.2607298029101854
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "
	1.3506178000596436
" my real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me .
	1.215037610247166
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .
	1.3834226237457652
lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars .
	1.187133774931922
mr gardie had waie only for the letters before he set off .
	1.5223962247332579
_her_ mind was less difficult to develope .
	2.0206321523811734
_their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her ' s_ she thought was still worse .
	1.4012721057192443
" what do you mean , hill ?
	2.2123514713030046
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some tiethrough a beautiful wood , stretching over a wieextent .
	1.2581653619353366
he has many friends , and he is at a tieof liewhen friends and engagements are continually increasing . "
	1.2937899008140572
by the author of " sense and sensibility . "
	1.689641683826995
" did you go by the village of kympton ? "
	1.6160910597662326
elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gaie by her attempting to pursue them .
	1.2419553922186524
my temper would perhaps be called resentful . - my good opinion once lost is lost for ever . "
	1.292540040393016
" yes , ma ' am , all . "
	1.6899265146225475
" my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london . "
	1.3796260315266355
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshie
	1.3459690509901312
" i have an excessieregard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled .
	1.210248212893856
but i confess they would have no charms for _me_ .
	1.6604233147175813
" but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham . "
	1.448430588295557
in what a disgraceful light might it not strieso vain a man !
	1.6101019479930923
" dear lizzy ! "
	2.999785724569072
they met several tie , for there was much to be discussed .
	1.5318561497262722
they lagged behind , whieelizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other .

" will you gieme leave to defer your raptures till i wrieagain ? - at present i have not room to do them justie "
	1.2973924992839736
i do not trust my own partiality .
	2.0518611716382233
i will only add , god bless you .
	1.8715595674196035
i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshielast year , i thought how liey it was that you should come together .
	1.1958768841854346
elizabeth made no objection ; - the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .
	1.3063260380913522
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smie it was decie .
	1.242867404825178
" well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses lievery comfortable , do they ?
	1.3127586017625266
" oh !

	3.9264452849583042
he smie , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .
	1.392099668639656
i am prodigiously proud of him .
	2.1916983863579054
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "

is nothing due to me on that score ?
	2.000664555419196
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .

mr bingley inherie property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not lieto do it . - mr

" but you - how are you ? "
	1.7821736727702309
" not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his tiehere ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months . "

	1.9371549935783732
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? "
	1.613525713715153
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her . "

" no ; but it must be done soon . "

" and of your infliction , " cried elizabeth with energy .
	1.6081666936842884
" i am afraid , mr darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "
	1.170329538194987
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . "
	1.210420038084276
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .
	1.2507587864685028
who attended to you ?
	3.4484560581436408
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away .

i am joie with him in the guardianship of miss darcy . "

" very well - and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "

her colour changed , and she said no more .

the adieu is charity itself .

" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "

i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
	1.251280382679801
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .
	1.6639504980655178
" care of him ! - yes , i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care .
	1.2344626184966943
i know you will do him such ample justie that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .
	1.3270949510712649
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . "
	1.3346876577521891
" that is a question which mr darcy only can answer . "
	1.4811341436726502
" you wrieuncommonly fast . "
	2.424446289795057
as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justieto those beautiful eyes ? "
	1.2030370253938032
cried elizabeth ; " but how could _that_ be ? - how could his will be disregarded ? - why did not you seek legal redress ? "
	1.20641296212115
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said mr bennet , " and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn .
	1.214564619702378
nothing could be more delightful !
	2.7310870516762544
my dear mr bennet , " cried his wie " what are you talking of ?
	1.471230273985837
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza !
	1.2268819079490385
" you have a house in town , i conclude ? "
	1.549414678279613
" no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must diviewith me .
	1.335615492502585
brother in - law of wickham !
	2.354936813135744
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .
	1.2041232164995128
it has often led him to be lieal and generous , - to giehis money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .
	1.1943660549050532
the next was in these words .
	2.323158151887632
i know it to be impossible . "
	1.904324763446865
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .
	1.1784735076651631
good or bad ? "
	2.830921091398328
i am sure you must feel it so . "
	1.6818833768478882
i now gieit to _you_ , if you are resolved on having him .
	1.4755127999215083
sir william had been delighted with him .
	2.0101038161098574
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater - what shall i call it ?
	1.2536511864925555
" well , so much the better .
	1.9973044996602913
" in the first place , " replied mr gardie , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . "
	1.2203574509411041
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .
	1.4391754815374957
" you know nothing of the matter .
	2.019746306635633
we must have mr long and the gouldings soon .
	1.7217540740199129
we _will_ know where we have gone - we _will_ recollect what we have seen .

" i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .
	1.2595801195097207
" with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it . "
	1.3330872286090913
" a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh .
	1.495638518851544
elizabeth then contrie to sit by her aunt .
	1.8526462503741974
take your choie but you must be satisfied with only one .
	1.5850793724941334
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .
	1.4285820943401177
lady catherieseemed quieastonished at not receiving a diet answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertiece .
	1.1931317508225052
in every view it is unaccountable ! "
	1.9651209857082523
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she .
	1.4397909650027336
charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth .
	1.493747306303952
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth .
	1.4248498574444832
mr darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fie on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprie
	1.2130434600148363
you see how continually we are engaged there .
	1.8670002032691446
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention .
	1.5314879169391329
you must not disappoint your father . "
	1.9140234197518635
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .
	1.2910505556311722
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catheries behaviour was most friendly and obliging .
	1.2359769067222557
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .
	1.2563002886474475
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquieif mr wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball .
	1.2335740561241018
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . "
	1.445241350067178
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty .
	1.4546326367320563
at present i am not in love with mr wickham ; no , i certainly am not .
	1.3805651438032698
i hate such false friends .
	2.6556892863996766
supposing him to be attached to me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?
	1.2723398647833986
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wiet ; and now , i hope you are satisfied . "
	1.1868604864950099
i hope they will not meet at all .
	1.8925456289634637
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy .
	1.8177907221481004
we were married , you know , at st clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish .
	1.2868660372255243
he is come - mr bingley is come . - he is , indeed .
	1.4758084195703354
" if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no ie of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagie "
	1.2277678864856933
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "
	1.682728557817326
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better . "
	1.2272573934209559
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
mr wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he receie at the other table between elizabeth and lydia .
	1.2584012247177272
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "
	1.5990346109067617
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house .
	1.3573174731672581
much as i abominate writing , i would not gieup mr collins ' s correspondence for any consieation .
	1.3352218981481405
who could have done less for her ?
	2.205999789709634
the housekeeper at netherfield had receie orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .
	1.193338930407793
" if your master would marry , you might see more of him . "
	1.411557126611485
" your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you .
	1.6911795175215936
he smie , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .
	1.5872076986768044
you know my mother ' s ies as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .
	1.3600923540384724
why is not every body as happy ? "
	1.7850924577821679
you supposed more than really existed .
	2.258477739865838
mr bingley and jane remaie at netherfield only a twelvemonth .
	1.6426554368499873
my youngest sister has left all her friends - has eloped ; - has thrown herself into the power of - of mr wickham .
	1.247494117322419
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken prie and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .
	1.2014821486606202
" have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "
	1.2955910987507073
charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say .
	1.8017463292133507
" but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? "
	1.3349649811985425
how are they even to be discovered ?
	2.1878861113890316
" prie " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe .
	1.252537414446134
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "
	1.2390395669022873
" she has one only daughter , the heies of rosings , and of very extensieproperty . "
	1.3334858350678622
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love .
	1.1950632463933806
his revenge would have been complete indeed .
	1.994033271083297
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arie his principal enjoyments .

" merely to the illustration of _your_ character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .
	1.3203356583952581
she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty .
	1.2534982723282555
he listened to her with perfect indifference , whieshe chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .
	1.179477812141792
" she is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her resiece there will probably be of some duration . "
	1.211497059596759
" you shall hear then - but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .
	1.491878740707225
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of dieting his friend .
	1.4745629125731543
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed .
	1.5907540103340376
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .
	1.2629525148965215
jane was beyond competition her favouriechild .
	2.2144450396694846
" i am more liey to want tiethan courage , elizabeth .
	1.649495744165859

" we have die nietie at rosings , besie drinking tea there twie - how much i shall have to tell ! "

_they_ will take care not to outrun their income .
	1.7486905617055248
" certainly , " replied elizabeth - " there are such people , but i hope i am not one of _them_ .
	1.2770889630677675
if elizabeth , when mr darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .
	1.16970360680278
but mr bennet , was not so well pleased with it .
	1.5849934547012077
i have a high respect for your nerves .
	1.8613221697949032
are you going much farther ? "
	2.1092527418523344
" there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .
	1.4105875905891094
jane was by no means better .
	2.1723960643713087
elizabeth made no answer .
	3.058178943089369
she was overpowered by shame and vexation .
	2.012278940018784
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day .
	1.526290876007652
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .
	1.224133533458822
" i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton . "
	1.3131399896211189
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts . "
	1.2686992470263467
" i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully ; " if _i_ should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia . "

does your charge gieyou much trouble ?
	2.401813152449879
" what could he mean ?
	2.8104981206352853
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman lie he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .
	1.3379906330050735
" i do not believe a word of it , my dear .
	1.5656047388343406
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit .
	1.4527427213253516
" and what did she say ? "
	1.920884752156743
thought she .

there was neither in figure nor face , any lieess between the ladies .

" but how did he account for it ? "
	1.6827216401962148
i cannot do justieto his kindness .
	2.2121747123926814
" it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .

_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will siece me on this subject for ever . "
	1.264516742434481
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waie on mr bingley .
	1.4899826852530216
" but you _will_ know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day . "
	1.2916757316903968
" i cannot see why mr forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia , " said she , " though i am _not_ her particular friend .

" if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it . "
	1.3560484225784961
it is because he will not giehimself the trouble . "

we dressed up chamberlayne in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , - only think what fun !

my child , let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in lie
	1.4974013647222633
how can it affect them ? "
	2.1025237055737396
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consie that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .
	1.332849805490217
" _you_ want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it . "
	1.3538671928962531
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologie for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .
	1.1969970455144323
" yes , madam , " said mr bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherie
	1.3784393525618346
and a special liece .
	3.2021024376342604
yes , i call it a _very_ easy distance . "
	1.6031357753859838
and so extremely accomplished for her age !

the commendation bestowed on him by mr reynolds was of no trifling nature .

collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him . "
	1.382363807059124
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now .
	1.4786454229549637
i shall go distracted . "
	2.384379501445862
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .
	1.2200588172970928
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written . "
	1.2552301173681395
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .
	1.249064724991401
mr bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .
	2.0087356708593607
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_ . "

why did she come ?

- and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr

she was confiet of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .
	1.2087024677483875
jane looked at elizabeth with surprieand concern .
	2.0751165895735055
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .

upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my lie as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . "
	1.167681724890081
it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended regard . "
	1.2651098923772688
" could i expect it to be otherwie "

mr gardie and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .

the whole party before them , indeed , excie a liey attention .

mr collins was eloquent in her praie
	2.195224364328811
what is the matter ? "
	2.4089389273467705
mr darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her .
	1.7713161519333533
but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties . "
	1.3580982617579753
" but my father cannot . - he wrote last week to hurry my return . "

" we never had any governess . "
	1.914901823946164
she was a little revie , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seie the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ? "
	1.1680533337443817
lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way . "

	2.1097375159843472
i was sometie quieprovoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .
	1.260953392359753
what am i to do ? "
	2.121745738443556
all that i can promieyou , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .

he begged pardon for having displeased her .
	2.0299730693789897
yes .
	20.601105807608644
mr bennet was quiein the fidgets .
	2.217531420139831
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "
	1.6871383754934068
" it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshie

	1.8237436252971089
repeated miss bingley .
	4.142634056724213
at that instant she felt , that years of happies could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .
	1.2521848748845712
i was gie good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .
	1.4097306837631207
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "
	1.2182669503433854
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .
	1.266107615973707
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .
	1.440130582919556
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .
	1.6383715221084296
my feelings will not be repressed .
	2.2521200625165454
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .

	1.9292582890419694
i knew you would be wishing me joy . "
	1.6789347647214212
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect .
	1.4538180595123738
no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .
	1.2882156996099556
if such goodness does not make her mieable now , she will never deserve to be happy !
	1.4099844773866719
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strieinto some other path .
	1.3527073665420197
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .
	1.1890630869211474
he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .
	1.2132679563709483
" your humility , mr bingley , " said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . "
	1.3637937589613776
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be notie by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .
	1.209072592188315
what a good joke it will be !
	2.170665358464064
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written fiedays ago .
	1.4162999660367608
what could your ladyship propose by it ? "
	1.777335398072065
but we must stem the tieof malie and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . "
	1.2460524231241934
he die with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday .
	1.3325482739158852
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "
	1.44389878765934
such a disappointment !
	4.571287736943849
cried elizabeth .
	7.257139087572168
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .
	1.6563859296741394
both changed colour , one looked whie the other red .
	1.6445448072148856
every thing that is charming !
	2.803982150192781
" he must be an oddity , i think , " said she .
	1.5232653784209498
you must send john with the young ladies , mr collins .
	1.621120403271935
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .
	1.2058689883550853
she had very little notiefrom any but him .
	1.8384445023392557
poor dear child !
	4.579671697468466
" upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield .
	1.2813342335970808
the housekeeper came ; a respectable looking , elderly woman , much less fie and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .
	1.2364165229123167
i wonder what he can be doing there . "
	1.6701108061562604
no . - i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "
	1.293937781483972
" no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton . "
	1.407997782260105
oh !
	18.52144218810643
" and this is always the way with him , " she added . - " whatever can giehis sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .
	1.185330129286892
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
it is a nielong walk , and mr darcy has never seen the view . "
	1.3738497485817731
as mr gardie began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same tiethat mr bennet came from it .
	1.1749649602704386
" _my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ , eliza , " said charlotte .
	1.39735324444735
poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .
	1.217263763745164
oh !
	18.52144218810643
here consequently was an iehaustible subject of discourse .
	1.8879254057917032
" a great deal of good management , depend upon it .
	1.6007329308279667

	2.902485288744037
mr bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last . '
	1.5475872919159173
" may i ask to what these questions tend ? "
	1.605260684076268
your ' s , & c . " edw
	1.9286874894333474
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .
	1.8786245934687922
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s change of sentiet will be neither improbable nor faulty .
	1.2730435155453057
what congratulations will then flow in !
	2.4812010954540265
our poor mother is sadly grieved .
	2.246875779656835
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte ' s marriage .
	1.2844801472290586
cried mr gardie , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelliece was all alie
	1.4238792335317907
if this be the case , he deserves you .
	1.7718342085573349
" fitzwilliam darcy "

besie , there was truth in his looks . "
	1.6767193539104244
" oh , lizzy !
	3.3189980721448813
" it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud .
	1.398054678390587
" i beg your pardon ; - one knows exactly what to think . "
	1.4088875281836288
but however he did not .
	2.6718080425997583
it became her turn to listen .
	2.251386212150454
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .

	1.4862244643416163
" i cannot be so easily reconcie to myself .
	1.7396985576702846
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more .
	1.1845466630493315
he meant to proviefor me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was gie elsewhere . "
	1.2208463158143679
they are gone off together from brighton .

	1.313937031327565
mr darcy bowed .
	4.232577135655831
during their walk , it was resolved that mr bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening .
	1.2647309405346034
can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "
	1.599706094355172
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .
	1.3774252461030443

kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her tiewith her two elder sisters .

i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all - and now despieme if you dare . "
	1.1799818135652276
but when you have had tieto think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done .

he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping lucases .
	1.202270784792108
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal . "
	1.4141268539579814

he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out liehis information .

" some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know . "

you have wiey mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these .
	1.302532787157157
though mr bennet was not imagie to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefie by marriage .
	1.1851176171523672
but let me advieyou to think better of it .
	1.7427542925367523
" were it certain that lady catheriewould think so , " said mr collins very gravely - " but i cannot imagiethat her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .

charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifieof her tie
	1.3535172585364188
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !
	1.747913032824261
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .

it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled .

it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !

his prie in that dietion , may be of servie if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by .

" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?

elizabeth sietly attended her .

soon after their return , a letter was delieed to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately .

	1.2186485301990573
" i had much rather go in the coach . "
	1.5911302724075176
mr collins on his return highly gratified mr bennet by admiring mr philips ' s manners and polieess .
	1.3292032762178343
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .

we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really lie him . "
	1.217771633892485
he was at the same tiehaughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .
	1.2620506695376739
the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation .

it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . "

	1.6616792423099793
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .
	1.3319168618065353
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind . "
	1.4376868707805999
i had not an ie of it . "
	1.7751961050027043
oh !
	18.52144218810643
cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .
	2.0464118280517987
but you have chosen your fault well . - i really cannot _laugh_ at it .
	1.4123904550199404
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?
	1.6047985062228598
i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .
	1.4145536243560854
i must beg to return to the house . "
	1.67377440908465
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it .
	1.3572492456869856
" yes .
	7.407897961673874
mr bennet ' s best comfort was , that mr bingley must be down again in the summer .
	1.3356165881469857
stpid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "
	1.498002472825183
shall you lieto have such a brother ? "
	1.7818517181410156
" perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson ; did not i mention it to you ?
	1.3379501706060797
" perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .
	1.355813189295832
" whiemary is adjusting her ies , " he continued , " let us return to mr
	1.5008849088999991
no , no , you shall not deceieme .
	1.8626629217887551
but they did pass away , and mr and mr gardie , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .
	1.256364640417045
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .
	1.214386870345694
he drew a chair near her .
	2.275453786620152
this was invitation enough .
	3.136409627758563
there ' s for you !
	2.733247425566379
what praieis more valuable than the praise of an intelliet servant ?
	1.70954830917535
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it . "
	1.240918180468293
" probably not ; - but mr darcy can please where he chuses .
	1.4988172177624612
i will think no more about him . "
	1.777197179262247
miss lucas perceie him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accietally in the lane .
	1.2244371981173845
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "
	1.449272252545097
" she is a very fielooking woman !
	2.1571594230098605
" that it ought not to be attempted .
	1.8599392443896736
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s .
	1.3991332775220149
" when i am in the country , " he replied , " i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same .
	1.1874267911799268
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happies in such an alliance .
	1.2263759970805022
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
mr bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .
	1.4452691292069015
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .
	1.29546468988928
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling . "
	1.7754424473616217
how i laughed !
	4.5658731518492885
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ?
	1.8679904001260839
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefie by it .
	1.334487627852692
_that_ abominable mr
	10.601126641744905
repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement .
	2.2252255937005425
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? "
	1.5467614850090476
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy .
	1.3170637367778748
" yes , very handsome . "
	2.1156654131296326
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him .
	1.377851829166589
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford .
	2.0629995758499238
my dear charles , what do you mean ? "
	1.6865676796403177
what shall we do with him ?
	2.403609893458187
" lady catheriede bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately gie him a living .
	1.3496723601452731
it is of all subjects my delight .
	2.0670684517390634
jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .
	1.413967609619526
whiethe family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them .
	1.369164546920157
bingley ? "
	5.836303621892865
let me hear from you very soon .
	1.9592735118738276
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s folly . "
	1.252556881233551
do you not consie that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "
	1.300353240739815
mr bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library .
	1.4555720501144924
first of all , he asked miss lucas .
	1.8689444461524265
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed !
	1.6489223747380126
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "
	1.57484776578699
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .
	1.4831854015149095
" you are severe on us . "
	1.922694511729016
she cried .
	7.773305354536543
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .
	1.22880015577612
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable .
	1.2447125639874475
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . - do you draw ? "
	1.222649428116049
" yes , i have had a letter from him by express . "
	1.4436376401769193
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .
	1.3723971469575709
we passed each other several tie .
	2.2588783601094344
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .
	1.229063139277473
his character is thereby complete . "
	2.085424072782586
it was the favouriewish of _his_ mother , as well as of her ' s .
	1.433150624115869
giemy love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey .
	1.4083053341612406
when tea was over , mr hurst reminded his sister in - law of the card table - but in vain .
	1.2982223450323662
is this to be endured !
	2.726954448098078
" i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did .
	1.3560967181240706
" you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
	1.4076659330223515
in this room they were receie by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mr hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lie in london .
	1.1918740664805325
it is just as he chooses .
	2.253439600449408
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this .
	1.5478560240149117
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliet must be all for herself .
	1.3537483082676367
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .
	1.519610630010308
though darcy could never receie_him_ at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .
	1.2543391895404348
" i must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .
	1.5744688729033625
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months .
	1.204470000444863
" i should never have consieed the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match , " cried elizabeth .
	1.3152767299805472
mr collins had a compliet , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smie on by the mother and daughter .
	1.2437265124667929
" but what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motie - what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "
	1.1909501517045327
i am so grieved for him .
	2.193581047302167
mr darcy !
	7.0932359386258845
" if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .
	1.1908034871147353
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . "
	1.4454737524914099
" depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all . "
	1.2794224677997657
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . "
	1.3864099944092578
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . "
	1.2476873955654115
the offies may not be so pleasant in general - ' s regiet . "
	1.4052166339613974
miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motie .
	1.2256005011613174
" my aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street . "
	1.1728886132067198
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham .
	1.2729336264583095
accompanied by a violent yawn .
	2.5777004923312634
" do you suppose them to be in london ? "
	1.6040111024638886
" may we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? "
	1.4267942943517014
i thought too ill of him , to inviehim to pemberley , or admit his society in town .
	1.3401393414241103
chapter i
	15.402741744352168
but gracious me !
	4.397618380484771
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .
	1.7737767209164952
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "
	1.2927185052472008
i am not indebted for my present happies to your eager desieof expressing your gratitude .
	1.407593319655404
miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .
	1.2354730769854827
she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .
	1.2857755354207547
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes .
	1.4383718446462466
never mind miss lizzy ' s hair . "
	1.7778519847666343
cried elizabeth , when she had finished .
	2.032793109261782
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "
	1.1733554924780505
" if one could but go to brighton ! "
	1.721828227095407
but to liein ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .
	1.2784718522013074
to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia .
	1.3406373755130878
there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king .
	1.5936194585773673
you must contrieto send somebody .
	2.5997896217660146
you _are_ a gentleman ' s daughter .
	2.0212323056774553
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .
	1.356688567504878
" but upon my honour i do _not_ .
	1.8918933962617706
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .
	1.2825106421813675
perhaps there was some truth in _this_ ; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody ' s_ reserve , can be answerable for the event .
	1.212303002473569
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of _you_ . "
	1.381033893396551
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .
	1.2830067987707774
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? "
	1.387625900910637
he spoke well , but there were feelings besie those of the heart to be detaie , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of prie
	1.196395641207312
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .
	1.2054573119494005
but i will not repie
	3.0612798455066748
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .
	1.300667025737393
she had already learnt that lady catheriewas still in the country .
	1.582098737730632
i _should_ say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . "
	1.3346253353116093
compliets always take _you_ by surprie and _me_ never .
	1.7328557846362933
" how can you talk so ? "
	1.9141711920622142
contributions to the project gutenberg lieary archiefoundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by us federal laws and your state ' s laws .
	1.2449287343793412
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .
	1.2764829872563253
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle .
	1.1904273353850474
and she coloured at the ie ; but , recovering herself , said in a liey tone , " and pray , what is the usual prieof an earl ' s younger son ?
	1.2008136904403177
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiet .
	1.2736713841280445
their manners are not equal to his . "
	1.773044329334508
they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .
	1.363316561285848
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr denny comes back from town . "
	1.2277670535844531
it was in the tie and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .
	1.2712942384400046
they must be a great loss to _your_ family . "
	1.5942010607500576
only think !
	7.286977478543473
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield .
	1.442195962052901
" and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently .
	1.6085187895254422
" my dear mr bennet , " replied his wie " how can you be so tieome !
	1.4053274614784625
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .
	1.344490310710952
there is one point , on which i want your advie
	1.6448350912338372
in spieof what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceiethat her spirits were affected by it .
	1.1824422103565304
generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself .
	1.534902027078527
four sie of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desieof being loved by her sister .
	1.2725426168382337
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .
	1.482415433147692
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .
	1.669176563528042
" books - oh !
	3.1868512996505625
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .
	1.1941361022571664
he added , that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclie at present , to leave london , and promie to wrieagain very soon .
	1.2608820274210637
it adds even another motie
	3.089790862961391
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .
	1.2929449246369968
at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .
	1.2724558274907314
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besie , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .
	1.2317774770441363
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceie us .
	1.5493941375289106
it was some tie however , before a smiecould be extorted from jane .
	1.4859274902936035
when breakfast was over , they were joie by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to liethem herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane .
	1.1876476607361723
" mr
	35.103838997844434
said elizabeth to herself . - " you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .
	1.2519533235597753
gieme farther particulars .
	4.204668656004125
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than prie "
	1.284012571920831
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .
	1.3729703988994661
" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservie rather adds to your other perfections .
	1.2245987558650662
no look appeared on either siethat spoke particular regard .
	1.7396688951051764
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determie
	1.211855693355396
i cannot think of it without abhorrence . "
	1.778097348873258
" i am not liey to leave kent for some tie
	1.9458632240501632
we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune . "
	1.53209751323375
" you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "
	1.542397316342743
she looked at jane , and smie , and shook her head by turns .
	1.4463940079047868
" oh , yes ! - that , that is the worst of all .
	1.4681246685906293
she lie him too little to care for his approbation .
	1.6511167386264012
the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remaie to be shewn .
	1.2835310406651694
one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .
	1.211072725465238
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second tiewith " it is _your_ turn to say something now , mr
	1.3424765824193026
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strieinto another path , she was overtaken by wickham .
	1.186101463167469
" this was a lucky ie of mie indeed ! "
	1.63052047910522
and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?
	1.233540763582459
i hope he will overlook it .
	2.2504390695810192
" no " - said darcy , " i have made no such pretension .
	1.4531873439607725
here are offies enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .
	1.413136663630758
it is admirable ! "
	2.9913354778887085
you have delighted us long enough .
	2.240201496315892
" not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercie "
	1.4792156350431809
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .
	1.4100898731844673
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "
	1.3598676687044458
" i can easily believe it .
	2.239880106981072
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it .
	1.271135477491854
" these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth .
	1.771948428647728
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach .
	1.2569704263498966
" if i were as rich as mr darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was .
	1.2012036550164003
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure .
	1.4623801469253095
he wrote me a few lie on wednesday , to say that he had arrie in safety , and to gieme his dietions , which i particularly begged him to do .
	1.1897959060336956
mr darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remaie with no very cordial feelings towards him .
	1.4089468649382335
they look upon it quieas their own , i dare say , whenever that happens . "
	1.3597582351025466
i would rather be paid the compliet of being believed sincere .
	1.595324869371461
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voiethat marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter .
	1.2338843030440356
miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .
	1.3744612042011122
stp me whilst you can . "
	2.1087531455464745
and is it really true ?
	2.795412348245662
chapter viii
	15.402741744352168
i will try again .
	3.1168043768481337
" i am astonished , my dear , " said mr bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .
	1.2276322110059905
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had gie him the earliest information of it .
	1.3629034829127242
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
" only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "
	1.2184864011451946
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "
	1.4445878343649203
i did not think mr gardie was so little to be trusted . "
	1.4480869795331894
" no - why should he ?
	2.4608756349449994
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .
	1.2981529739818882
i send no compliets to your mother .
	1.9746694428065665
i had not the smallest ie of their being ever felt in such a way . "
	1.3544232216903247
" i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character .
	1.3084266676920036
miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding . "
	1.2181789732223811
you had much better dance . "
	2.0914771138011456
jane was therefore oblie to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .
	1.2297605704020496
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "
	1.4967322598646295
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
	1.8674407353473028
cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .
	1.8443892383901646
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .
	1.5395720750605686
jane had sent caroliean early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .
	1.2565028410638843
said jane .
	7.0583341259177494
that he has neither integrity nor honour .
	2.041958228898302
<NUMBER> . f3 .
	4.228503689896403
you do not know what i suffer . "
	1.7844185137435444
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .
	1.3178036828288962
" if you _will_ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .
	1.3566016699846777
" that is as it happens .
	2.2678785125298733
mr bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevaie on to accept him .
	1.1852641542975542
" and this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection !
	1.3383852549081368
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just receie from longbourn . "
	1.3519506186738535
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for dietion .
	1.4883124740206137
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew .
	1.481615409638179
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please . "
	1.2788774190979983
you must learn some of my philosophy .
	2.0378041467583095
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her . '
	1.2951579136671705
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praieof his sister ' s proficiency .
	1.5853189006503272
" i lieher appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ies .
	1.5006039325712859
" lady catherieis a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added charlotte , " and a most attentieneighbour . "
	1.2692869128407125
people _did_ say , you meant to quit the place entiey at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true .
	1.2529828233529101
and when we _do_ return , it shall not be lieother travellers , without being able to gieone accurate ie of any thing .
	1.253288248070944
in the dining room they were soon joie by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .
	1.20279417156941
so imprudent a match on both sie ! - but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .
	1.2397748967261284
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .
	1.3323754914496162
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometie an indiet boast . "
	1.4107263598214987
at length , she spoke again .
	2.2194112944906834
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
	1.591590535085558
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislieagainst him , that could be so called .
	1.2118130067010067
us laws alone swamp our small staff .
	2.0326099714191885
" why will you think so ?
	2.3947647831214334
i cannot think so very ill of wickham .
	1.8334425635280658
absence had increased her desieof seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr collins .
	1.392791129873083
mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voiewas weak , and her manner affected . - elizabeth was in agonies .
	1.212152255016814
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .
	1.7356830376918633
mr bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .
	1.1738219881857817
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .
	1.3246896530177164
only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her twie and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second tie
	1.288570019517649
lydia was exceedingly fond of him .
	2.18883828471532
every body is disgusted with his prie
	2.152258361417954
" not yet , " replied jane .
	2.042801760884725
she will follow wherever lydia leads .
	2.2639283364898333
" well , lizzy , " said mr bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of this sad busies of jane ' s ?
	1.2630402174772015
" you are consieing how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner - in such society ; and indeed i am quieof your opinion .
	1.210066891259692
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .
	1.2450285897253839
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .
	1.5910052320116355
" that is right . - you could not have started a more happy ie , since you will not take comfort in mie
	1.2646257608784228
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !
	2.183115892173542
it must be his own doing . - he is his own master .
	1.469584678994778
it is a pity they are not handsome !
	1.976875080849257
he knows where we lie
	4.6274583280165045
never had his wit been dieted in a manner so little agreeable to her .
	1.4585877385273507
" our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of liewho can afford to marry without some attention to money . "
	1.179931036687866
chapter xviii
	15.402741744352168
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins , and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy . "
	1.2508797859526308
" but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure .
	1.398988684843099
" no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertiet of him to wrieto you at all , and very hypocritical .
	1.2062113798897764
darcy mentioned his letter .
	3.0958469147868652
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . "
	1.440685805427941
" i see your design , bingley , " said his friend . - " you disliean argument , and want to siece this . "
	1.2200241036144224
wickham only shook his head .
	2.6449328263096596
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
	1.3380827440137895
" they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !
	1.283167533850441
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . "
	1.266015145940229
" then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr bingley to _her_ . "
	1.250856402565074
you are not well enough ; - you cannot go yourself . "
	1.490752676094499
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy .
	1.2266699132289125
are you quiesure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
	1.4950681923297482
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?
	1.24374040229444
" my dear lizzy , do not gieway to such feelings as these .
	1.4938235079760582
and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead .
	1.3625619825436817
" and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters . "
	1.5365129729481457
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
<NUMBER> . e7 .
	4.228503689896403
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i ca not wrie so i will dictate , and you wriefor me .
	1.2123591882600127
" aye - that is because you have the right disposition .
	1.5928398801118608
mr darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding .
	1.6598895654913968
" what could become of mr bingley and jane ! "
	1.6310153915046943
her heart was divie between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .
	1.3918618727518663
" you have said quieenough , madam .
	2.1394074542845565
it is of no consequence .
	2.558494553824715
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing lieit , has been advanced .
	1.2225997092754188
" what , none of you ? "
	1.9211475602336872
" how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !
	1.254465450735282
chapter xv
	15.402741744352168
you must wrieagain very soon , and praiehim a great deal more than you did in your last .
	1.3385234326188002
with the mention of derbyshie there were many ies connected .
	1.6244259505906256
" are they indeed ? "
	2.3921986533081188
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappies she had brought on her family .
	1.1735544937096332
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .
	1.297326685907346
excuse me - for i must speak plainly .
	1.8457935709171116
thank heaven !
	7.311326899126368
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object .
	1.9919389921878854
he was full of joy and attention .
	2.000752051069016
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her .
	1.2140506070023895
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .
	1.244087905700456
things are settled so oddly . "
	2.1211827028230954
and it was not wholly without foundation .
	1.9972858337289263
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .
	1.2165913933382018
allow me to say , lady catherie that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged .
	1.1979289829669284
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receiesuch a letter ! "
	1.5021599678711963
if _i_ can perceieher regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . "
	1.2781541112038155
the loo table , however , did not appear .
	1.7658182627776677
come be quick , be quick !
	2.38891865960441
" do not keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake !
	1.4993954993008618
lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself .
	1.2306143854293965
collins . "
	5.88601776996019
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquie , without constant practie
	1.348567047095959
" how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved . "
	1.1953618546511058
elizabeth went away with her head full of him .
	1.7270999534483504
said elizabeth .
	7.171353744561802
you will be a very happy woman . "
	1.7765215928759683
said miss bingley ; " will she be as tall as i am ? "
	1.416656697832571
" never , sir . "
	2.4300830315401076
" let me wriefor you , " said jane , " if you disliethe trouble yourself . "
	1.3389267457182406
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "
	1.4259923021112737
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me .
	1.2245885554019198
elizabeth could not but look surprie .
	2.2134112416725182
mamma would lieto go too of all things !
	1.9411754700245363
" and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good , " added kitty .
	1.314440901051256
" she is a great fool for going away , if she lie him . "
	1.3803386989271293
" i must ask whether you were surprie ? "
	1.6759961181794036
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .
	1.3637865873054453
" what is his name ? "
	2.0856344303177186
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement .
	1.2031220435133123
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .
	1.4281173475970754
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .
	1.483826933261852
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshie when that conviction had been gie , was scarcely the work of a moment . - i cannot blame myself for having done thus much .
	1.1804063114614927
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "
	1.4199305468948786
" yet it is hard , " she sometie thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hie , without raising all this speculation !
	1.1973304420907078
miss bingley was not so entiey satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .
	1.415949973611238
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .
	1.334093542774475
i guessed as much . "
	2.4132526095364635
chapter ix
	15.402741744352168
" i see no occasion for that .
	2.1128155648384346
" i should not mind any thing at all . "
	1.5982577559172717
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favouries guilt ; but really consieing his descent , one could not expect much better . "
	1.1935801064160618
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .
	1.268897258425356
" how strange ! "
	2.9716064283909787
" but why all this secrecy ?
	2.4730917105958947
" oh , yes .
	3.4099116034116377
on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .
	1.2961379215913738
but whatever may be the sentiets which mr wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .
	1.2283763377881858
but the gentlemen will have mr bingley ' s chaieto go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs . "
	1.2397261377847708
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind !
	1.9818541853020362
" yes , " replied wickham ; - " his estate there is a noble one .
	1.3850577109501625
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .
	1.25485395547199
and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission !
	1.2223161660708353
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr philips ' s .
	1.2545694176353077
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .
	1.193144996872726
why was he to be the judge ? "
	1.7856054554435634
_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn . "
	1.7653205721954566
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .
	1.496526374143094
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .
	1.3624792783919208
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of lie
	1.501363330032005
cried lydia .
	7.0616066958888775
jane was distressed .
	4.020551973988102
they followed her into the dining parlour .
	2.0104152287834265
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them . "
	1.2209559144409878
" you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth .

in <NUMBER> , the project gutenberg lieary archiefoundation was created to proviea secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations .
	1.259928100132633
" i never heard any thing so abominable .
	1.842576969612215
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparatiepoverty .
	1.5203212683725242
what could be more natural than his asking you again ?
	1.7413681031042105
mr gardie abused her stupidity .
	2.5546731002334546
miss bingley immediately fie her eyes on his face , and desie he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .
	1.2341473533723928
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .

bingley , she had lieieseen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .
	1.2947483736771808
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . "

" not the slightest .

nonsense , how can you talk so !
	2.170396510087342
mr bingley followed his advie
	2.9738055066305367
he protested that she should receiefrom him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .
	1.3790995421992598
so tall ! - oh , my dear lizzy !
	1.8141495349188521
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart .
	1.2630623638413847
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
" my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "
	1.541583706504616
we must not make him desperate . "
	1.9198900830631958
make haste , and come down this moment . "
	1.6736411333196153
" i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "
	1.2633524821139699
" i often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends .
	1.2614142002957205
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praieof mr bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admie him .
	1.1851378837011488
in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprie every possibility of earthly happies .
	1.3918490979077505
" it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began .

he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "
	1.4915015060892427
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motiehis cousin could refuse him ; and though his priewas hurt , he suffered in no other way .
	1.2071349554868482
mr gardie and her niece , however , did her justie and pitied her .
	1.4507082971613587
to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lie , or any thing .
	1.2318713947632682
his regiet is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the - shie and of his being gone into the regulars .
	1.2322741790743468
i could not bear to have her ten mie from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . "
	1.2388904061567525
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were .
	1.2766698383717823
" wrieto me very often , my dear . "
	1.6861562893810254
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on busies .
	1.2559844539535798
" i hope , " added mr gardie , " that no consieation with regard to this young man will influence her .
	1.2730051735793702
we neither of us perform to strangers . "
	1.784764330257853
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i gieyou leave to liehim .
	1.4588044606221389
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remaie quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room .
	1.173907938150664
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .
	1.241846947771348
yes , " said elizabeth drily - " mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "
	1.2029777975220446
but think no more of the letter .
	1.9960113800916157
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .
	1.3310804719561558
" aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advie her most strenuously to engage one .
	1.1776118366355761
it was an encouragement of vie and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it .
	1.272424864284976
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .

" poor wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !

	2.537828344872598
shocking ! "
	6.380557273654015
how could i be so silly as to wish it !
	1.7413421372497482
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
	1.2390077516842657
she had instinctiey turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , receie his compliets with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .
	1.2547505654631916
this must be the grossest falsehood ! "
	1.9916333679481995
elizabeth smie at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .

if you will believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight .
	1.2685666128974273
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the - shie as clearly as mr gardie could do .
	1.2544578501803831
" you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . "
	1.4447979211484718
lydia left a few lie for his wie informing her of their intention .

these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposiemillie , watching the sentie on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .

painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .
	1.4483266687218022
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liety - which it is not worth whieto relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless .
	1.1938845030125456
" does that young lady know mr
	2.6938061447017727
" i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other .
	1.258235239190065
miss bennet still looked all amazement .
	2.2284333893094534
" my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you .
	1.4190319377086562
" what will be his surprie " thought she , " when he knows who they are !
	1.4118010243440047
and who knows what _may_ happen ?
	2.422022343189941
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear .
	1.4403215391733069
" that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth .
	1.4278485543783013
mr gardie , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressieof her wonder .
	1.3101530177017178
" no , no .
	3.7796870243692533
" mr darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again .
	1.2314766420261825
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ies , forbore to inviehim to sit by herself .
	1.351097780994038
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that _she_ would not gieinto it .
	1.2399464595433825
on miss lucas ' s persevering , however , she added , " very well ; if it must be so , it must . "
	1.22383478226786
i can recal nothing worse .
	2.553248830188739
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happies to jane .
	1.55159581926242
mr wickham began the subject himself .
	2.290208681918946
darcy . "
	5.808147770706102
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .
	1.4083768616214765
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .
	1.297605417659465
i wonder when you _would_ have spoken , if i had not asked you !
	1.5090350805684283
how shall i bear so much happies ! "
	1.8322390319324027
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .
	1.2523943978515213
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .
	1.2868208960558511
a liey imagination soon settled it all .
	2.050168171054829
in niecases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels .
	1.3833979513728272
mr bennet ' s eyes sparkled . - " a gentleman and a stranger !
	1.5072950887732768
" no , my dear ; i think not .
	1.8095948158621977
she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits .
	1.2621146254654745
she is not such a simpleton .
	2.228613896121876
they must have seen them together for ever . "
	1.6791505654087675
you have no compassion on my poor nerves . "
	1.6835842289627136
it distressed her a little , and she was quieglad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposiethe parsonage .
	1.285805928293586
she is quiea little creature .
	2.573468832547961
i thought i should have broke my heart . "
	1.6782108163282523
it is eviet that you belong to the first circles .

chapter xi
	15.402741744352168
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contaie much good sense and solid reasoning .
	1.1946681414209976
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence .
	1.2026718476338065
" you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason .
	1.3395694491772547
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you .
	1.507348564305671
" i do not think we were speaking at all .
	1.6766131032063074
" your picture may be very exact , louisa , " said bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me .
	1.2677972700593247
but i will no longer importune my young cousin . "
	1.5965461557233045
_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .
	1.2022269559395322
" complied with !
	4.583478367033519
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "
	1.2794640060847786
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .
	1.2335836088793573
besie , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the - shiehave left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "
	1.192761134515365
every thing nourishes what is strong already .
	2.0116528971006185
and she rose as she spoke .
	2.2876707556838936
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment .
	2.0703925518730464
" and mary king is safe ! "
	1.971429378129652
everything wore a happier aspect .
	2.5928041420855976
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone . "
	1.2199080673564775
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .
	1.24320652132495
the wiet and the best of men , nay , the wiet and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in lieis a joke . "
	1.1659014238609526
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s .
	1.4299791755209421
" yes , all of them , i think .
	1.8120563124195719
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .
	1.4909694562013942
the moral will be perfectly fair .
	2.256981236064393
gardiner "
	45.441445608712115
how he lie i know not .
	2.3061423164918704
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quiewell yesterday se ' night . "
	1.29335896592213
for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well .
	1.410154839704492
cried miss bingley , " charles wrie in the most careless way imaginable .
	1.4833994284227394
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before .
	1.283075706740753
" indeed you are mistaken .
	2.7132890448661335
" yes , indeed , " cried mr bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .
	1.3250770258943267
it cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened .
	1.33362273881994
i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .
	1.2587126085235016
well , he is a very undeserving young man - and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .
	1.2044321814560934
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entiey so .
	1.2486110749266477
lady catheriecontinued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .
	1.317161334782207
by the author of " sense and sensibility . "
	1.689641683826995
mary and kitty , thank heaven !
	2.3578804887449647
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motiefor her calling .
	1.2749996540265354
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .
	1.4388426229679003
_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it .
	1.4369490641532865
when first mr bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son .
	1.226169202504265
the girls stared at their father .
	2.2738906013155384
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .
	1.6348982172484712
i london : printed for t egerton , military library , whieall .
	1.570147070558706
with a book he was regardless of tie and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raie such splendid expectations .
	1.1754806559119642
mr reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .
	1.3239043295695954
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
i felt a little uneasy - a little fearful of my sister ' s happies with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .
	1.1792460140213252
she heard the carriage drieaway as she proceeded up stairs .
	1.6563312947220878
" i know them a little .
	2.2443656130673517
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .
	1.5260234961588743
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mr forster , the delight of mr bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be descrie .
	1.186249754854899
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .
	1.863672935456331
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away lieother young men . "
	1.3329646048531905
the comfort to _her_ , of the regiet ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .
	1.3782124971926242
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .
	1.2439368950805494
she explaie what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudie had been removed .
	1.2926166097193474
their table was superlatiey stupid .
	2.5612766804354616
" indeed , mama , you are mistaken , " said elizabeth , blushing for her mother .
	1.3594783292801222
she felt that she had no busies at pemberley , and was oblie to assume a disinclination for seeing it .
	1.294885587488689
he has more to gie
	3.00449582992975
" i do not know when i have been more shocked , " said she .
	1.4389941982048695
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes .

the project gutenberg lieary archiefoundation ( " the foundation " or pglaf ) , owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg tm electronic works .
	1.2235682448934082
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .
	1.1900660183035607
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner .
	1.2505276894431359
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money .
	1.4156671424000717
nobody wants him to come .
	2.6406129173386867
i did not expect such a compliet . "
	1.772487467559838
he was on one sieof her mother .
	1.9963662899918038
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .
	1.4894879966841306
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?
	1.508502024875366
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? "
	1.5351119646398121
" i have , sir . "
	2.1388469884270314
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .
	2.697179098857206
i shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
	1.1792907670117247
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together .
	1.5829688246354436
how rich and how great you will be !
	1.9964984144110545
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .
	1.185559166458312
i should have consieed it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .
	1.3215762491671212
" oh ! "
	4.022789383027674
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "
	1.2459341295819715
said he hastily , as he opened the door .
	1.7358104448389788
who would have thought it !
	2.7495943416135025
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .
	1.2533885987000142
" you must gieme leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .
	1.2471323083464834
thank heaven !
	7.311326899126368
" well , then , you need not be under any alarm .
	1.5227408246195193
he danced only four dances !
	2.7989507296258314
with a triumphant smie they were told , that it was ten mie round .
	1.4801569735746463
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s .
	1.327515238766324

her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .
	1.5462297846220128
" go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks .
	1.303104220038944
but she would not be secure .
	2.2913313498046906
her report was highly favourable .
	2.556126217788933
he cannot know what mr darcy is . "
	1.7774622257169075
" if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes . "
	1.1964974198824805
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .
	1.5287734711223846
" yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "
	1.6014652569628542
" mr darcy is not to be laughed at ! "
	1.6385334706580454
" good gracious !
	4.377741392828952
she certainly did not hate him .
	2.182609066636526
this is your final resolve !
	2.7458839272177635
" but that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinie that it gie me very little ie .
	1.2253951467243132
even elizabeth began to fear - not that bingley was indifferent - but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .
	1.249537314466208
the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !
	1.3232408605417791
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman .
	1.5797314390830832
to put me on my guard ?
	2.4446720054952777
mr and mr gardie smie .
	2.6157035999274396
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excie .
	1.2274400799139433
elizabeth replied very conciey that she was .
	2.0912970724301885
" no - i cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else . "
	1.2496846406808682
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as liey to gieany news of him .
	1.3305439294810175
" is it possible ! "
	2.473594862410257
how he must have felt it ! "
	1.9522034714928815
why jane - you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing !
	1.5142911236025074
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quieso chatty .
	1.2525638272616935
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .
	1.768086684119665
by you , i was properly humbled .
	2.033523082144172
compliance requieents are not uniform and it takes a consieable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requieents .
	1.238132335411806
but do you think she would be prevaie on to go back with us ?
	1.4989998386814358
but does not jane correspond with the sister ?
	2.038288872813406
" you know of course that lady catheriede bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr
	1.3143456807329557
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ?
	1.7483251536615563
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "
	1.2118828012835794
all was joy and kindness .
	2.56623231479758
" no really , " replied elizabeth ; " i think there cannot be too little said on the subject . "
	1.2628860043438488
the bennets were engaged to diewith the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins .
	1.2049268608454702
yet he knew to the contrary himself .
	2.029793362148826
" yes , yes , they must marry .
	1.9135205799071677
this matter may be consieed , therefore , as finally settled . "
	1.4927528862034432
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .
	1.4880251310903223
you must not suspect me .
	2.559944780913956
" you may as well call it impertiece at once .
	1.6601227085937798
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s .
	1.6114939934058288
" i have heard much of your master ' s fieperson , " said mr gardie , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face .
	1.21008014053369
" tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
	1.4497193807330342
" colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ' s sie but nothing to giehim any alarm .
	1.232014828073077
mr bennet replied that he had not .
	2.069708646613294
how unlucky !
	7.484886325762242
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justie
	1.486282986439991
there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .
	1.3029605061904377
" mr annesley is with her .
	2.2557292740707098
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .
	1.2614252631369354
i have not been accustomed to such language as this .
	1.675508384051847
nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .
	1.6034294530417421
" how many letters you must have occasion to wriein the course of the year !
	1.468870766548005
a carat character is used to denote superscription .
	1.8771931001604418
my temper i dare not vouch for . - it is i believe too little yielding - certainly too little for the convenience of the world .
	1.2266382892297258
is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?
	1.3006844042557104
" that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter .
	1.3254151347588836
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley .
	1.730005466186486
the foundation ' s principal offieis located at <NUMBER> melan dr s fairbanks , ak , <NUMBER> . , but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations .
	1.2030818447963632
" indeed , " replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drieaway his regard for me .
	1.2014654440796968
can his most intimate friends be so excessiey deceie in him ?
	1.664337014535104
i came to you without a doubt of my reception .
	1.6836787100122417
" but so we all do .
	2.2639073809815513
pray apologiefor my having dislie him so much before .
	1.7379674420592426
" how despicably have i acted ! "
	1.9783199470233366
then taking the diegaged arm of mr darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself .
	1.3783246123359076
" very , very much .
	2.5956660018623845
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
" it did .
	4.560502539586104
i will take care of myself , and of mr wickham too .
	1.541882556934943
darcy . "
	5.808147770706102
" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room . "
	1.4091161061017212
they were , therefore , to go . - elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .
	1.1976524966115254
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .
	1.490234885156455
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing .
	1.4785490091365168
" i certainly shall not .

pride and prejudice : a novel .
	2.254284996765082
" i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied .
	1.3896814284899532
" mr collins , you must send a servant with them .
	1.567390314178121
is not he a charming man ?
	2.420287856170216
and do you really love him quiewell enough ?
	1.9745470582473112
her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .
	1.2038361223064178
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .
	1.9621001086741061
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .
	1.5031940792655922
no one made any reply .
	2.598645071981366
" yes ; i do comprehend a great deal in it . "
	1.491131297745029
" from mr collins !
	3.3663848016167095
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .
	1.2323980118807139
" you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mie but which i have never acknowledged .
	1.301344147544463
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .
	1.390060553033536
" except , " thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate . "
	1.4169278196541815
why should they try to influence him ?
	2.14902244023169
at such a tie much might have been said , and siece was very awkward .
	1.4108856844218631
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a lieal man , and did much good among the poor .
	1.2965917177111426
you need not .
	4.485264896045235
" hate you !
	4.634780642571564
how i wanted you ! "
	2.50418746311919
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth sietly consented .
	1.3684999366949762
but it was her busies to be satisfied - and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .
	1.2534248872223617
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .
	1.4866098696964059
and then we were so merry all the way home !
	1.7470473126644295
<NUMBER> . f1 .
	4.228503689896403
and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .
	1.4174014000487085
" _that_ you certainly shall . "
	2.104834145214363
the old lady is mr jenkinson , who lie with them .
	1.5714785328457883
lydia , my love , though you _are_ the youngest , i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball . "
	1.2147084314096601
mr reynolds could interest her on no other point .
	1.7171899075970964
said charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
	1.7308968803029068
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? "
	1.333247736634761
" to walk three mie , or four mie , or fiemie , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quiealone !
	1.2371496434057472
at length the parsonage was discernible .
	2.226150004861922
we acted with the best intentions . "
	1.9311885476854422
what relates to yourself , is as follows .
	1.896399206358487
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sie , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "
	1.266056133229365
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mr forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .
	1.2172391987723883
" and if i had not a letter to wriemyself , i might sit by you , and admiethe evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .
	1.1962952564923315
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening ? "
	1.6118181732647296
" i beg your pardon .
	2.5197164591597514
the second began .
	4.341640037638412
in understanding darcy was the superior .
	2.209324047287488
and his answering immediately to the last question - oh !
	1.7007613701376054
of the lady ' s sensations they remaie a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was eviet enough .
	1.2416346919192522
she repeated .
	7.231559710834554
said her mother .
	4.12028011030292
" and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertaie a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? "
	1.2231191734148343
" none at all .
	3.2242964133647614
i am going away myself . "
	2.093723838024325
but are you pleased , jane ?
	2.4728948688114833
" and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . "
	1.3159710255981563
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .
	1.5228047168280394
" not as you represent it .

" no , no , nonsense , lizzy . - i desieyou will stay where you are . "
	1.3112156753141084
they met again on sunday , and then _i_ saw him too .

you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <NUMBER> . f3 .
	1.2115621569928907
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy . "
	1.3327466838772095
" she is my youngest girl but one .
	1.868609179574828
" is he married or single ? "
	1.918767141492674
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happies , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoie
	1.2475379455046374
mr bennet made no answer .
	2.5318720867229096
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .
	1.2642592230864145
oh !
	18.52144218810643
they are descended on the maternal sie from the same noble lie and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .
	1.1919166186638264
" i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before .
	1.220807209919651
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
	2.0023360330267286
elizabeth coloured , and said - " a little . "
	1.6099160618233688
" but it is , " returned she ; " for mr long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "
	1.2111160036305808
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notie but he certainly has not known her long . "
	1.264913844255753
the ie of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .
	1.4826123159244908
were questions with which she amused herself .
	2.0088883091876055
" true .
	7.963469042604523
elizabeth was forced to go .
	2.55923472742432
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "
	1.4913339957006495
" you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .
	1.4052098741151784
darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .
	1.5345253538278325
jane ' s is nothing to it - nothing at all .
	1.5986653155842139
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .
	1.3047239435060753
" it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . "
	1.263469474338279
he is so excessiey handsome !
	2.7739993107512886
darcy smie and said , " you are perfectly right .
	1.6767377589487882
we can all _begin_ freely - a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .
	1.186980209291564
good gracious !
	7.200444693654676
they were not the only objects of mr collins ' s admiration .
	1.532846201628783
i thank you for explaining it so fully .
	1.861537495401633
those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "
	1.6052998436061048
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary polieess , and i confess that i did not expect to receie_more_ than my due . "
	1.218751685771461
" can i have the carriage ? "
	1.9143956666650246
yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .
	1.3157508565106346
it would have been strange if they had .
	1.9592677103602472
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwie
	1.5141954716993775
at length , in a voieof forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting !
	1.2381719876610984
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ .
	1.2674311147247468
but these are not jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design .
	1.4130190268072484
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblieyou , and will save all the best of the covies for you . "
	1.2399297348428155
" why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "
	1.2414953165232943
it was really a very handsome thought .
	1.9614619452787838
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .
	1.6574817650904172
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all <NUMBER> states of the unie sttes .
	1.2707826679006544
i hope i never ridicule what is wieor good .
	1.7569927779913566
where shall you change horses ? - oh !
	1.916980755972263
they were in - street .

" i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliet on the sweetness of my temper .
	1.2157637131845005
but what is that to me ?
	2.4078321364599935
said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with . "
	1.3581989849575364
but it ought to be done , and if you will gieme a sheet of paper , it shall be done dietly . "
	1.239604701348742
" excuse my interference . - it was kindly meant . "
	1.531988862631137
" his manners are very different from his cousings . "
	1.5994620383487872
this mr younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelliece of him , as soon as he got to town .
	1.196756594945682
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet . "
	1.4933833120823006
but enough of this .
	3.3182289963019307
exclaie elizabeth , " you are too good .
	1.8755893976100901
" yes ; - but he seemed to liehis second better . "
	1.483824145091848
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .
	1.396280247765699
if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him .
	1.3621099058566508
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .
	1.7371581909691403
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliets to your lady and daughters , your well wisher and friend , william collins "
	1.326215962857527
what sister would think herself at liety to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?
	1.4030206691083102
oh , that i knew how it was ! "
	1.7171541869133387
" we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .
	1.2851219238819536
" sometie .
	8.487947991676249
but _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .

with _them_ he is remarkably agreeable . "
	1.9104070326567644
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not lieat all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . "
	1.1667763409514575
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
	1.1922100133416587
" you are over scrupulous surely .
	2.261294361411546
" design !
	7.4773880796034735
i am sincerely grieved for him and mr f but no one can throw any blame on them .
	1.3302399346299854
it is impossible that he should still love me . "
	1.5872662750458626
you may depend upon my seeking no further . "
	1.6895105355607314
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desieof generally pleasing than any other man . "
	1.2288855960669371
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .
	1.5475293965978858
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to lieon .
	1.2890320188942337
their reception at home was most kind .
	2.0049315123281066
i thought i should have died .
	2.2936208968807916
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertiet .
	1.308972685500818
" yes , almost every day . "
	1.9198142455882934
but your _family_ owe me nothing .

that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating . "

_we_ were always good friends ; and now we are better . "
	1.4808460889581354
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "
	1.383970355000304
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .
	1.1979769020966504
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .
	1.4778551692460988
cried lydia .
	7.0616066958888775
" i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had .

you have deprie the best years of his lie of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .
	1.2768674640467423
mr bennet ' s schemes for this day were iefectual .
	1.6521890888956412
" come , darcy , " said he , " i must have you dance .
	1.4242514878082646
" oh , yes ! - of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt .
	1.3460609777747607
" a thorough , determie dislieof me - a disliewhich i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .
	1.3241709619051596
" you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . "
	1.5500739852059804
said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam .
	2.0051323713297764
that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "
	1.278696116550336
" all young ladies accomplished !
	2.7372533874472924
" why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .

she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ' s height , or rather taller . "
	1.3822803091399973
his diffiece had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mie made every thing easy .
	1.2312372615746747
" but not before they went to brighton ? "
	1.680029121109611
" ten thousand pounds !

she will make him a very proper wie "
	1.939408100815722
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .
	1.596101262991928
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr darcy might have done as well . "
	1.174600333989324
well , well , i only hope it will last .
	1.6841512870378188
" if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapsie " cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "
	1.2153826523539095
what will you think of my vanity ?
	2.1622287294951095
but they were entiey ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving home .
	1.2154288150713406
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement .
	1.7446578100512629
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . "
	1.379306270905166
" whiei can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . - i think it no sacrifieto join occasionally in evening engagements .
	1.1983066919405103
sty , stay , i will go myself .
	1.8626001528991851
the visit was returned in due form .

	1.550700431365308
" i do not know . - i hope there was . - but to be guarded at such a tie is very difficult .
	1.2435327684805808
cried bingley .
	6.955544567741146
" and what is your success ? "
	1.9258981734538894
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .
	1.7242649317816412
mr bennet protested against any description of fiey .
	1.8812266586939292
" your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .
	1.534851232023937
mr collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
	1.3006482796335725
mr bennet chose to consie it as gie in compliet to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .
	1.1826176992608826
" your surpriecould not be greater than _mie in being notie by you .
	1.4871523476927422
" wickham so very bad !
	2.7864849425767124
" pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motie
	1.286726808111657
" the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them .
	1.223583342494123
elizabeth had not before believed him quieequal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .
	1.1770169029856872
mr bingley was oblie to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . mr bennet was quite disconcerted .
	1.18569107537074
she smie , but made no answer .
	1.9884941698067657
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a unie sttes copyright in these works , so the foundation ( and you ! )
	1.2149945865324259
" and do you really know all this ? "
	1.6828312606611648
" upon my word ! - well , that was very decie indeed - that does seem as if - but however , it may all come to nothing you know . "
	1.1680304280812377
it was all conjecture . "
	2.390788494156465
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .
	1.2914060159864023
his behaviour was attentieand kind to the utmost .
	1.8597378707503618
when mr collins said any thing of which his wiemight reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte .
	1.2207912547390758
" ah !
	7.632497423247497
" you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . "
	1.4582722964730597
you are lucky in having such a master . "
	1.6816708511467904
" has she been presented ?
	2.830622295056912
" my dear , dear lydia ! "
	1.9820964626377395
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determiewhether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .
	1.2226399721529604
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for _your_ approbation alone .
	1.3352668762560236
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .
	1.309326956248388
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mr
	1.2844972412086544
" let her be called down .
	2.235823615003942
mr gardie declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .
	1.4396655500289115
" i should imagienot . "
	2.410762273528116
said he , smiling .
	3.467806007662608
mr bennet was really in a most pitiable state .
	1.7487933512983678
i will have no reserves from _you_ . "
	1.7828494454741524
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future lie
	1.5039787801263023
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again .
	1.2913334614888363
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshie than as she had seen him at pemberley .
	1.2088150736947954
mr gardie himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .
	1.2000721984632745
i know no harm of her . "
	1.9171075676609917
" how near it may be to _mie , i cannot pretend to say . - _you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . "

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .

she followed her father to the fieplace , and they both sat down .
	1.4816435583957581
" you used us abominably ill , " answered mr hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . "
	1.2176392152047388
darcy ? - you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . "
	1.3811115691981917
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .
	1.51922846061186
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !
	1.5469748585766525
he has heartily forgie me now . "
	1.9185615466434398
" i never saw any one so shocked .
	1.8533966967172293
i am sure wickham would liea place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quiemoney enough to live upon without some help .
	1.2054605445383442
" all ! - what , all fieout at once ?
	1.7563830155809825
but what does he say of the living ? "
	1.6818802278432772
so high and so conceie that there was no enduring him !
	1.657817942728591
how i should lieto be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls .
	1.2664521184446895
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confie to his cousin , why is not he to make another choie
	1.2904580478663856
" can such abominable prieas his , have ever done him good ? "
	1.4512175280164532
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "
	1.3115276424813573
" not at all .
	3.246701572973998
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! "
	1.469883489172844
the park was very large , and contaie great variety of ground .
	1.5165895470465967
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him .
	1.4481399759996478
" it is no such thing .
	2.2145480357048437
of this she was perfectly unaware ; - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .
	1.180185985633372
it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all lie "
	1.4398691587877583
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .
	1.186194658939765
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .
	1.610718574629501
" indeed i have , sir , " was her answer .
	1.5882681843604234
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determie , to be pleased .
	1.442114660691294
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entaie as ever .
	1.2046856746934627
how long has she been such a favourie - and pray when am i to wish you joy ? "
	1.3014071672793868
now , lizzy , i think i _have_ surprie you .
	1.6646013930461343
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .
	1.2827174687378902
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant .
	1.2934138593638966
" no , i believe not . "
	1.922773658605836
then pray speak aloud .
	3.1763399981860774
" dining out , " said mr bennet , " that is very unlucky . "
	1.3837282722584272
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .
	1.2718690239110748
elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression .
	2.091015123447153
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .
	1.4404473766518684
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer .
	1.3344483305439356

there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .
	1.1846825680295932
" i am sorry it went off .

on the following monday , mr bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wie who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn .

mr bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare tie but the remaining five set off together .

he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .

mr bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accietal recommendation to look at netherfield house .
	1.2538635032853334
lady catheriemight see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must gieway .
	1.2660921644838707
observed mr bennet .
	4.200840115477133
the least agreeable circumstance in the busies , was the surprieit must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .
	1.2231105589208948
the whole party have left netherfield by this tie and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .
	1.2303533831460527
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the busies of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company .
	1.1823960710240942
" indeed , mr collins , all praieof me will be unnecessary .
	1.536609273413601
" well , and what news does it bring ?
	1.837221546745176
she danced next with an offie , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was uniesally lie .
	1.2453293493127222
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday .
	1.233037352393358
they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , whieexamining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .
	1.1777928096198655
she dietly replied , " you need not be frightened .
	1.659562602675434
but he had gie a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .
	1.3632161028803123
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .
	1.3415829057526116
the morrow produced no abatement of mr bennet ' s ill humour or ill health .
	1.4059195485514218
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .
	1.2632917604226293
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? "
	1.3537040045966617
no motiecan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ .

they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .
	1.3903983228229062
my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .
	1.306869454739644
mr collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ?
	1.39964028063049
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .
	1.1949434748475958
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr
	1.5856917898790008

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by busies .
	1.2740187161109608
said mr bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .
	1.3018615620957994
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . "
	1.1638502300655527
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .
	1.2070944677801152
they are all for what they can get .
	1.848488139129959
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the offies .
	1.2222449745914532
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved .
	1.594122710336212
what do i not owe you !
	2.3887263288977385
cried mr bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls .
	1.3604609125418181
elizabeth replied that it was .
	2.711749762086286
" it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley .
	1.38954912419116
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him .
	1.1889327755149568
* * * * * " good gracious ! "
	1.7122511583193833
mr wickham had receie his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiet at the end of a fortnight .
	1.249733444955387
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . "
	1.2088909884531134
there was no help for it however .
	1.9895515638841696
" but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about .
	1.2987576236434828
elizabeth joie them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .
	1.315272783914605
all lovelies and goodness as she is !
	2.138004319480174
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .
	1.4133116700784292
" i think she will .
	2.717598636780152
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .
	1.582882179709717
mr collins was punctual to his tie and was receie with great polieess by the whole family .
	1.3529049374143154
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer fiey and summer engagements arose .
	1.285389536054916
" thank you - but i always mend my own . "
	1.5345816848832174
mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .
	1.5586396620639607
when they had gaie their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroliebingley ; what it contains , has surprie me a good deal .
	1.1881490020908674
let me mend it for you .
	2.2429342776343155
and what sort of young lady is she ?
	1.9997972615664772
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were siet .
	1.5889556030864216
" well , " cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose .
	1.5001478663792183
and to see dear wickham too !
	2.359941023675493
but this ie was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr darcy walk into the room .
	1.1883375647714969
his disposition must be dreadful . "
	2.095935310004528
mr wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat - a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return .
	1.286563054218585
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . - oh !
	1.4784358038796162
society has claims on us all ; and i profess myself one of those who consie intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . "
	1.2023944639111157
" why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley .
	1.3801911008608303
mary , " said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !
	1.343350081734959
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .
	1.214700602555922
in three volumes .
	4.2240890619524265
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you .
	1.2838546640596533
on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .
	1.2831893561093373
next to being married , a girl lie to be crossed in love a little now and then .
	1.3383142863132194
but , however , that sha not prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determie .
	1.3507555763179115
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .
	1.570023400373547
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "
	1.3194460489340558
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it .
	1.1996046711296544
lady catherieis far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .
	1.3545581168795018
" and is this all ? "
	2.117530261070534
the venison was roasted to a turn - and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .
	1.3135448732271802
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .
	1.6879152728470235
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determie to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .
	1.1894534579683556
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together .
	1.2375878670359552
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour .
	1.2062851470926397
" pray tell your sister that i long to see her . "
	1.4858675315086738
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .
	1.4491445504653895
" very well .
	4.299735905014947
after sitting a little whiewith jane , on miss bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .
	1.2043438093055814
charlotte herself was tolerably composed .
	2.5824934686147913
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .
	1.4242491706678717
" yes ; to the last .
	2.2990880909013027
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .
	1.2395566061406058
" certainly .
	7.919057734882497
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometie planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .
	1.444065433044256
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .
	1.5828802789089307
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !
	1.2608245967291236
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence .
	1.2817982264177257
<NUMBER> . c
	6.564352859725503
elizabeth turned away to hiea smie
	2.557721833863965
hear me in siece .
	3.1050587073043263
" there can be no doubt of that .
	1.9321433970032036
elizabeth ' s congratulations were gie with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .
	1.2714558427723823
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .
	1.2064956202230286
_i_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entaie on me . "
	1.411324214919418
mr darcy smie ; but elizabeth thought she could perceiethat he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .
	1.300387366881392
" a man who has once been refused !
	1.95973483199755
chapter viii
	15.402741744352168
" oh , yes ! - he was to come there with wickham , you know .
	1.416373130591349
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .
	1.416128424970615
" with great energy ; - but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . "
	1.3122862748273671
" and so was i "
	" there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confie to his air , and is not unbecoming .
	1.193713002082836
does she lienear you , sir ? "
	1.9242046432237008
very nonsensical to come at all !
	2.402661360785214
" that is not an unnatural surmie " said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousings triumph very sadly . "
	1.2192583572153015
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done .
	1.4073186529789856
there can be no occasion for your going so soon .
	1.6391312236219864
of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance !
	1.8368062899116233
and if i am that choie why may not i accept him ? "
	1.452139565791314
but we are all liable to error .
	2.0400751688943517
" i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth .
	1.773740410667904
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
it convinced her , that acciet only could discover to mr bingley her sister ' s being in town .
	1.319055597732053
" my dear , you flatter me .
	2.0250143030404635
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .
	1.5283309774781975
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confiece in his friend .
	1.1915585654208753
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
" and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choie
	1.2728987805421843
" oh !
	6.985285251897767
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smie too much .
	1.493052527583704
are the others coming out ? "
	2.1128867718309103
she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might ariein that quarter .
	1.3126210994475795
collins ! "
	6.397432790096487
" that is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .
	1.3168847203811138
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the tie but mr darcy they had only seen at church .
	1.2687460856582227
are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet ? "
	1.5463383405521378
mr bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .
	1.5192939993024064
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherie
	1.1755681916139356
she declared her resolution .
	3.1260395638929466
" good heaven !
	4.4540276804435655
i was never more annoyed !
	2.7196469852778593
kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .
	1.422784761198089
how strange must it appear to him !
	2.1212030895931044
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage .
	1.3493916863408628
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwie
	1.2480096055124694
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam .
	1.9537988512856566
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations .
	1.4933237599671285
it was a long tiebefore she became at all reconcie to the ie of so unsuitable a match .
	1.336977204620424
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would wrie but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .
	1.2622230049450134
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition .
	1.4048196301172549
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .
	1.2495808358558866
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .
	1.3381843477382316
in a moment they were all out of the chaie rejoicing at the sight of each other .
	1.3570299796931018
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man - he is a great friend of darcy ' s . "
	1.2929643284502905
he had entertaie hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .
	1.1994181596917208
elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .
	1.3098823539447304
elizabeth said no more - but her mind could not acquiesce .
	1.588395026367579
with a strong prejudieagainst every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield .
	1.295751942498202
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . "
	1.1654413716657166
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself . - of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudie , absurd .
	1.2073404675193684
pray do not talk of that odious man .
	1.880004813353811
elizabeth was surprie , but said not a word .
	1.7180493780960888
" i honour your circumspection .
	2.615322751718151
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy .
	1.5557836444883462
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .
	1.234681453272496
" from the former .
	3.1398856972204885
it must be my uncle ' s doings !
	1.9573138216488435
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
	1.2818431533299433
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .
	1.358378505195859
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all .
	1.3055395837453176
" oh yes ! - they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to scotland . "
	1.1700527536078715
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .
	1.1862561580134643
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merie reproach , her sense of shame was severe .
	1.1779389586592046
" and yours , " he replied with a smie " is wilfully to misunderstand them . "
	1.333422486931652
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually siet on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confiece could ever subsist between them again .
	1.186319177098331
we have not met since the <NUMBER> th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . "
	1.2786458859891456
what is it about ?
	3.4602707464440714
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?
	1.7725321816435355
" i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his tiethere in future .
	1.2570066062226617
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .
	1.2295681416681852
they found mr bennet still up .
	2.290060021020556
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .
	1.3776316643836828
what will wickham say ?
	3.5217951586516363
i am so happy .
	3.294742636906744
" blame you !
	4.491374974603563
it amazes me , i confess ; - for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .
	1.286783972700993
did she call to refuse her consent ? "
	1.7801230412840139
mr collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure . "
	1.4107726671834846
what hours of transport we shall spend !
	2.1022040494511476
the liety of communication cannot be mietill it has lost all its value ! "
	1.4329755752550648
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motiewithin her of good will which could not be overlooked .
	1.2677060438398107
bennet ? "
	5.9290743356016025
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention .
	1.2338660540160176
mr collins knew not what to make of him .
	1.72913631364334
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch .
	1.297083779344122
bingley lie your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than lieher , if she does not help him on . "
	1.2399893512332683
" did charlotte diewith you ? "
	2.1001943691344622
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .
	1.4088113067251948
