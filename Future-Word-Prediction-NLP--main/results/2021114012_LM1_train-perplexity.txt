elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of consieing the last half hour with some satisfaction , though whieit was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	2.2124592954919406

as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it .	1.9515978413338793
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr darcy chose to doubt it - or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeie all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .	2.285464588821037

" well , " said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happies , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .	2.4867772505712296

jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffiece of affection sometie overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	2.002493208669544

a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catheriede bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of prieand obsequiousness , self importance and humility .	1.9979742948620565
" let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "	2.122476499035675
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , whieshe added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "	2.1690270061870316
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and whieshe steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contaie in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any tieby their renewal .	2.001999026101671
bingley was quieuncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were mieable .	1.90657794784634

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infiniey superior to any thing they had expected .	2.1704522764689056

" it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometie a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	2.327778272066256
" has your governess left you ? "	1.2791638968147676
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshienews , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	2.0684372017000108
" and can you lieiedeclare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ? "	2.1815830975530672
i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun . "	2.79597984110454
my dear , " continued mr bennet , " i am quiedelighted with him .	2.4904799534247695
" not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . "	2.1374743108730816
it originated in mr gardie , who , fatigued by the exercieof the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s .	1.941855447738733
she blushed at the very ie ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	2.1834998653109805
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea .	2.0293981683645264
when is your turn to come ?	1.778998653400361
and what sort of table do they keep ?	2.2250258515035117
she is almost three and twenty !	2.100625213717288
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	2.097625588785866
" not that i _shall_ though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "	2.2594123634278604
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been consieed in hertfordshie	2.1509330482252653
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	1.9764878168483901
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voiewhich proved it to be mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	2.3970881784813636

" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fie on .	2.6646415423507324

" i assure you there is quieas much of _that_ going on in the country as in town . "	2.161460014590555
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quiea shame if he does not . "	2.4219426285034094
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .	2.2804605712057735
oh , lydia ! "	1.0254815448281533
" no , not at all . "	1.737726240084656

in a few minutes , mr bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . "	2.515592856178509
" had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? "	2.084988668285341
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invie her to follow her up stairs .	1.9888547231131943
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it .	2.2964429129337294
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	1.9623428873430628
" you judge very properly , " said mr bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	2.198622676258271
cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? "	2.1190360770364336
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	2.326856134211618
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will giesuch pleasure to all my dear family !	2.6046902220791983
miss bingley saw all this lieie and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the - shiemilitia removed from meryton ?	2.0712473293863245
" with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "	1.8290990463488683
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entaie . "	1.9249112947786258
" about a month , " said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshie i understand . "	2.073579134101804
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	2.3704776517088866
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	2.293696750457678
when that busies was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	2.7055871199201773
they will then join his regiet , unless they are first invie to longbourn ; and i understand from mr gardie , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south .	2.215528036814438
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determie not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	1.8923900091646602
you may imagiewhat i felt and how i acted .	2.0183178614128066
but georgiana would not join her .	1.7230002351041676
when the ladies were separating for the toiete , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	2.189101373857656
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room . "	2.381236851656322
" it is more than i engage for , i assure you . "	2.7591044551911685
his words seemed to imply it .	1.447435874539007
they were confie for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	2.4305733324737377
by nature inoffensie friendly and obliging , his presentation at st james ' s had made him courteous .	1.6963270789832903
" why , my dear , you must know , mr long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaieand four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "	2.37000915211297
" i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , - and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	2.2819991284179446
the strangeness of mr collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	1.8994181079409747
" he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	1.812554265245907
" there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "	1.9082545833755589
that lady i suppose is your mother . "	2.2229798784661794
the happies which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	2.252016194547619
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .	2.4151403315002793
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	1.8334270843598464
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , - what could it mean ?	1.9385463545522597
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it raie hard .	1.9190363732047944
mr bennet could not have chosen better .	2.7526820959805094
the promie letter of thanks from mr collins arrie on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted .	2.0055597865448727

" do you prefer reading to cards ? "	1.9996934899520926
and she was only sixteen last june .	2.033325167695162
elizabeth had now but little tiefor conversation with her sister ; for whiehe was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself consieably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometie occur .	1.9728278943199429
" to jane herself , " she exclaie , " there could be no possibility of objection .	2.239055727671661
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper dietion . "	2.1712989522179145
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "	2.4872821596333967
i will wrieto my sister gardie about them dietly .	2.086213461970722
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mr bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	2.2268825121509392
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will giehim a good name .	2.283591279180281
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . - elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoie at it .	2.117425042683837
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	2.156983731703391
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requie .	2.192529820604242
then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet .	1.5246404108467655

but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one tie "	2.0706510247877237
" but if i do not take your lieess now , i may never have another opportunity . "	2.2537334961967526
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quiecertain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . "	2.3157652248059293
the effect was immediate .	2.0491608392978273
not that i care about it , though .	2.269517825961094
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happies , without reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "	2.0186311864681397
" no .	0.7215098688949719
in another minute mr bingley , but without seeming to have notie what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	1.9508703739372129
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	1.9914219074182133
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	2.342332980542529
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happies again , and promie their father another letter of thanks .	1.9938783334402157
" take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "	1.7618377150142377
as they drove to mr gardie ' s door , jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	2.2905336272041206
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mr	1.9845245362486907
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevaie on to go down without one of her sisters .	2.3616555098330188
mr gardie , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicatieess by his questions and remarks ; mr reynolds , either from prieor attachment , had evietly great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	1.980792137781171
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	1.6435490596032754
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admieher at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quiestruck with jane as she was going down the dance .	2.3834500023567804
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgiehim any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "	1.9276912392349044
" indeed i do not dare . "	3.204145604077394
he was resolutely siet however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshie how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' _she_ a beauty ! - i should as soon call her mother a wit . '	2.16055294158979
" was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , whieshe was ill at netherfield ? "	1.9876193287332895

the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his sie of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desieof never meeting again .	1.8928482795581119
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .	1.7889581845312235
her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .	1.6700590094108998

prierelates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "	1.8707296445560246
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him .	2.2106000952247475
" lizzy , you must not do so .	2.1504950991895315

you see on what a footing we are .	1.9579349098316203
" i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr wickham .	2.4374984550860455
" no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprie "	1.8189507094268167
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	1.790473052945485
" we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either sie " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy .	2.3380157441246587
elizabeth notie every sentence conveying the ie of uneasies , with an attention which it had hardly receie on the first perusal .	1.9828236980221925
your sister i also watched . - her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remaie convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she receie his attentions with pleasure , she did not inviethem by any participation of sentiet . - if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error .	2.055518913483182
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated tie	1.9370675302491183
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	2.3414480679454095
" i am , dear sir , & c . & c . " mr gardie did not wrieagain , till he had receie an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	2.35188748689451
darcy shook his head in siet acquiesence .	1.760327366022046
nothing could gieeither bingley or myself more delight .	1.667457512925543
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	2.224385219306026
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	2.277464059347313
you have a sweet room here , mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	2.2929805533961507
her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us .	1.6370116973013713
his choieis disinterested at least , for he must know my father can gieher nothing .	1.8124771107482451
had she not seen him in derbyshie she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	2.2241034483365167
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not liey , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? - impossible .	2.036677082162108
" you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .	2.409470251695963
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entiey , for she was a most determie talker ; but being lieieextremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prie , to have attention for any one in particular .	1.9677491022149598
if you should have no objection to receieme into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november <NUMBER> th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ' night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherieis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provie that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	2.0166654041251784
after walking several mie in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was tieto be at home .	2.027027254031852
they must all go to brighton .	2.0007493145998057
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ?	1.860847383911933
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty !	1.953769858780629
her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at tie , have gie any thing to be privieed to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	2.279700260428774
' ah !	0.7215618471291694
to catherieand lydia , neither the letter nor its wrie were in any degree interesting .	1.817085351179187
" compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	1.8664981202275672
it is not quiea week since they left brighton .	2.0823960448901553
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiet , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourie . "	1.9828306309739065
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !	2.369534486430365
" it is a compliet which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . "	2.2992010230557893
mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	2.1594723771428046
" who do you mean , my dear ?	1.945616389145796
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper .	2.1459190912579187
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !	2.1041484136165343
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	2.0700934291824167
mr gardie was surprie and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every ie gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	2.356236799165674
elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprie to find that he entertaie no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catheriede bourgh , by venturing to dance .	2.3101455940107845
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	2.1706172448961927
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confie and unvarying society . "	1.9624006134004233
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .	1.9041459370637384
lady catherielistened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual delieation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance .	1.8714556553590853
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , receie some assistance from her desieof getting rid of elizabeth .	1.9889952701331683
" i have been used to consie poetry as the _food_ of love , " said darcy .	2.4248307157086813
in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably diegaged tone .	1.9201824698234677
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - delieated on the probability of each statement - but with little success .	2.0831785972025467
mr bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	2.0359401358648785
lord !	0.7215098688949719
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is liey to be in this country much longer . "	2.709605994221833
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley .	2.5282028902835543
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	1.9814445633501112
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshie and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happies , were within thirty mie of each other .	2.0516586332009457
_they_ will never be distressed for money .	1.5857156132335188
" _that_ is a failing indeed ! "	1.4036923179459895
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every ie was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaie , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .	1.9649887470047147
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	2.164777032658424
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "	2.5346237467501815
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polierequest that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as poliey and more earnestly negatie , she seated herself .	2.091984447605206
had his character been known , this could not have happened .	2.059737695357027
in revolving lady catheries expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasies as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	2.0497236109033508
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mr bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them tieto see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	2.1803769040693073
they are my old friends .	1.7892648413256753
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admie every remarkable spot and point of view .	1.9254451948912952
within doors there was lady catherie books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lie in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	1.9586170530031781
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !	1.8236687718697973
after sitting long enough to admieevery article of furniture in the room , from the sieoard to the fender , to giean account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr collins invie them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	2.187127079324181
" and will you promieme , never to enter into such an engagement ? "	1.9840057861461537
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherie " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practiea great deal . "	2.35263179715613
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .	2.3562684519638473
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with .	2.4262112039987374
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	2.035576565276369
i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	2.1064506711690356
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	2.081084419221013
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	2.483824196281388
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been gie up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	2.1619283228895654

as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	2.7563914853766316
she was more alieto the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	1.9993496430237503
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some tie allowed her at last to go - saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quieat leisure . "	2.048180003566506
" how could i ever think her lieher nephew ? "	1.6648317743018755
mr gardie had seen pemberley , and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well .	2.264062419336434
he could not help seeing that you were about fietie as pretty as every other woman in the room .	2.2918870105482974
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - or i may say , three very silly sisters .	2.1764134566005686
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .	2.7153261132835245
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr and mr gardie were half a quarter of a miebehind .	2.559187794455125
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . - i know it cannot be long . "	2.2271274521285003
but in spieof the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consie it entiey hopeless .	2.294509428502848
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !	1.9982531949701128
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .	2.0566101144132425
again she read on .	1.725281191464723
but he is a lieal master , i suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . "	2.096723535541691
she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .	2.509349062092124

" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshie my dear cousin .	1.8474123157137858
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	2.3979742656139154
" not one . "	1.329652207597941
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mr wickham frequently invie her to come and stay with her , with the promieof balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	2.1763153546066443
" how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "	1.8443859392558877
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favouriechild , should be distressing him by her choie should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in miey till mr darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smie	2.215149874747727

sir william , how can you tell such a story ? - do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? "	2.5446244241559013
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	2.1428677122874364
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character . - oh !	1.8291693203819095
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she receie an invitation from mr forster , the wieof the colonel of the regiet , to accompany her to brighton .	2.265354541296385
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mr bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh !	2.1158200566519114
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwiein her thoughts at the tie than as she hoped that , by carolies not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	2.0969491850487545
" i should lieto know how he behaves among strangers . "	2.1974275844042213
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	1.9672302135387925
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , fieand twenty years ago .	1.7540681698870952

he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaiethat brought them from epsom .	1.947501072253248
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to gie and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !	2.2749671637596043
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .	3.207753438467997
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	2.20432658159715
" yes , there can ; for mieis totally different . - will you hear it ? "	1.6465421840411756
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .	2.000455630712827
it cannot be concealed from any one .	1.8990714820142152

on mr and mr gardie ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declie , and they parted on each siewith the utmost polieess .	2.365614957932863
" no , indeed .	1.1843539675359833
do not imagie miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	2.045730547803215
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "	1.614230009493467
he bore it however with admirable calmness .	1.985041771191872
had they fie on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislie make it so delightfully absurd !	1.881228524197161

she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	2.1318494048984364
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .	2.4696377002959338
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mr hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest .	2.1492947937432256
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "	2.277513213259243
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .	2.201434331733031
there was no want of discourse .	2.239639292444764
wickham . - wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourieof my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . - but from the severity of that blame which was last night so lieally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motie has been read . - if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensieto your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry . - the necessity must be obeyed - and farther apology would be absurd . - i had not been long in hertfordshie before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . - but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . - i had often seen him in love before . - at that ball , whiei had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accietal information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had gie rieto a general expectation of their marriage .	2.21795752011144
he then said , " i have receie a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	2.203820895007236

her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .	2.170975907599667
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mr philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he consieed the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	2.2769677120834437
there was also a postscript to this effect .	1.88077309630065
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	1.5848321777157153
mr bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liety of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mr collins well . "	2.3363677326692294
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	2.0065395867517233
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . "	2.705566859314497
console lady catherieas well as you can .	1.5868881825362797
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	2.1881848142468825
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a tieexclaie , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourieof his father ! "	2.1236127450118003
" in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .	2.1428331758415933
mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	2.2327267599071603
at present we have nothing to guieus .	2.4685526885851097
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .	2.076394569145409
- you provie in accordance with paragraph <NUMBER> . f3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <NUMBER> days of receipt of the work .	2.10895913623462
" how can you contrieto wrieso even ? "	1.7100308792530865
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy .	1.7847499595752985
she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprie the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town dietly , and of their meaning to diethat day in grosvenor street , where mr hurst had a house .	1.935824231925089
" yes , sir , i know i am .	2.1056444268445773
but their removing from the chaieinto an hackney coach is such a presumption !	1.9106422081607632
its completion depended on others .	1.2512752583290123
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waie , is not it ?	1.9979546600061335
lady catheries unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	1.761695510867568
" i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .	2.0225027027669853
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	1.832325494081468
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	2.4842886643073747
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? "	2.0654344526883412
mr bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressiein her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advie which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happies of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	2.225720970153007
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .	2.210229143176445
it is a truth uniesally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wie	2.1658857431490244
said he , as he joie her .	2.481713260107581
jane looked at her doubtingly .	2.3566420233631447
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .	2.4302723945307307
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy , it determie her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	2.1159828107784975
" exceed their income !	0.9328947856831536
elizabeth was surprie , but agreed to it immediately .	2.032746955896671
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prie by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	1.890835260042078
no . "	0.7215098688949719
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .	2.427562728226277
we will go round the park every day .	1.9657551205995105
" a little sea bathing would set me up for ever . "	1.6604319466357957
mr collins was also in the same state of angry prie	2.216046706991368
on their being joie by mr bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	2.349782623802254
" what is it you mean ? "	2.2034481668882226
" you shall have it in few words .	2.1942731573650827
this ie lasted whiea turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .	1.682147165714343
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	2.443218427174437
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	1.8907700196501898
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .	2.193970139445209
mr darcy may hug himself . "	2.190996090513537
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happies where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoie in his domestic comforts .	2.134067818567005
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed !	1.9139238902573317
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he lie with her . "	2.32304371197827
the express was sent off dietly .	1.4380049857002637
" he is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , liey ; and i never saw such happy manners ! - so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "	2.337230381410128
he heard her attentiey , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "	2.0042415035235885
she attracted him more than he lie - and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself .	2.1338452836730997
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to giepleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	2.319906411675882
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .	1.9901876674168033
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visie ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppiewood which bordered it .	1.8466834963596817
she had gaie her point , and had tieto consie of it .	1.9753007534576723
importance may sometie be purchased too dearly .	1.289591751300246
mr philips was quieawed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the - shie	2.2565064726560693
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .	1.983770871611424
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favouriedaughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	1.9019491295105504
" i wish i might take this for a compliet ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful . "	2.7239345926382605
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	1.825761802461516
do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without promietly displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph <NUMBER> . e1 with actielinks or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg tm liese .	2.1938030733247267
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happies in having obtaie the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explaie that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherie he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	2.147603517616339
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .	2.9205267481069015
this is not the sort of happies which a man would in general wish to owe to his wie but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will deriebenefit from such as are gie .	2.046385372085469
i saw them the night before last . "	2.040910132883644
whiethus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy , by the feelings which prevaie on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	2.320939060449488
" oh !	0.7215098688949719
the others then joie her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in siece .	2.007241110311771
she related the subject of the pictures , the diesions of the rooms , and the prieof the furniture , in vain .	2.0280529979500725
chapter iii	1.1163468009164315
he was receie by mr bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious polieess of her curtsey and address to his friend .	2.117108123219116
" i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second tie	2.076304713990662
" i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	1.841882566943726
mr reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s lietie	2.196398776868885
" but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "	1.9279098826809093
" it must have been his sister ' s doing .	2.642139819804804
not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	1.6865102098586064
" but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "	2.604275798064582
" this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "	1.870688385716852
" i should be sorry indeed , if it were .	2.4862507614415983
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fie with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .	1.8945011892043955
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	1.8780536614936834
your mother insists upon your accepting it .	1.4488000027080246
he does not want abilities .	2.057100093153981
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .	1.7627603958289797
" yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have consieed her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "	2.133735183737004
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitie .	1.9824159198287408
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quienorthward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .	2.300744191931725
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislieof the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fie on .	1.9006593203052098
let me hear what it is . "	1.8276799681592681
do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "	1.925710320506736
is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "	1.7301494200997818
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	2.1682155708370265
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	1.9691232148350792
she went on .	1.980581717382118
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .	1.9386121304995088
chapter i elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	1.9935872689083252
your ' s , & c . " mr darcy ' s letter to lady catherie was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr bennet sent to mr collins , in reply to his last .	2.3519484528991206
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking busies , he was quick in its execution .	1.7395610921014437
" that is to say , you had gie your permission .	2.3646446977758973
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	1.9473643230310966
there is nothing else to be done .	2.714051333896638
she saw with the creatieeye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with offies .	1.8836474481900214
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousings praie but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derie this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as liey to marry _her_ , had she been his relation .	2.3852430459250082
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . "	2.29818163867678
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	1.7945628258372393
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . "	2.641837092674086
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherie and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were requie .	1.936651813771718
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagie till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a tiewhen the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the ie .	2.1007642062487393
what did colonel forster say ?	2.1679127591135114
" i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .	2.450351665531767
" it was a subject which they could not mention before me . "	2.6313463677497047
every body said how well she looked ; and mr bingley thought her quiebeautiful , and danced with her twie	1.9946429812964201
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choie had fortune permitted it .	1.9905034978689424
you know my sentiets . "	2.1984037428066623
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy - that mr darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoie the netherfield ball the very next week .	2.307108557401387
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	2.017005410981737
when this information was gie , and they had all taken their seats , mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admie and he was so much struck with the sieand furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mr philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catheries drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliet , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room .	2.1242882118246995
it was unpardonable .	2.2555597881959093
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	2.1113513935677917
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	1.840850231560436
" what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "	1.7597409913061286
but that is one great difference between us .	2.109133613417376
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quiedistracted .	2.5881109630190138
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	2.161289112217611
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . "	2.0321982472696467
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and gieas much trouble as i can , - or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away . "	1.9272762004606798
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happies ; and thirdly - which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advieand recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .	2.3184218509539365
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spieof a great opposition of character . - bingley was endeared to darcy by the easies , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	1.9835035559251413
bingley . - but - good lord !	1.8103574945684817
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	2.4676909278860895
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	1.6782839638018487
oh , no . "	1.0254815448281533
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?	1.7885778414929585
miss darcy ' s praieoccupied the chief of it .	2.3825889747992575
he readily agreed to it .	1.636733086679244
her astonishment at his coming - at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshie	2.08064575365157
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this tieof year . "	2.0737279080695883
chapter ii	1.1163468009164315
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "	1.8567289513070597
such a countenance , such manners !	1.6081054478944121
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was delieately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one sieof the paddock .	1.788875590813806
the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermie whether most to be pleased that he explaie himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious .	2.1104661885060896
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - and perhaps you would not express it quieso strongly anywhere else . - here you are in your own family . "	2.178803952752928
if you are outsiethe unie sttes , check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading , copying , displaying , performing , distributing or creating derivatieworks based on this work or any other project gutenberg tm work .	2.1557213692125736
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted - " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smie on each other .	2.2305621941534826
" can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? "	1.8054103148267007
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	2.3690421825680525
poor jane !	0.9926229831439831
how acutely did she now feel it .	1.5629278379261662
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can descrie and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the siece and respect which her rank will ieitably excie	2.0293799909024077
mr bennet had been strongly inclie to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetieand prieof one who had ten thousand a year .	2.1748344697500057
" and i have another favour to ask .	2.435943914609008
" yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing .	1.4785747830401437
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .	1.8556460745934291
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? "	2.32075514987798
unfeeling , selfish girl !	0.8442816669084672
you take delight in vexing me .	1.6806711126084177
but in what proportions it should be divie amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	2.1672508339898036
she is gone down to her uncle at liepool ; gone to stay .	2.564874352955612
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	2.3152121363719944
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to presieat his table , nor was mr hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consie his house as her home when it suie her .	2.0496976176791346
certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "	1.7413886466025874
by tea tiehowever the dose had been enough , and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to inviehim to read aloud to the ladies .	2.2235768751475424
is _her_ husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ?	1.8103487859729128
" my love , should not you lieto see a place of which you have heard so much ? "	2.1475930748482366
they will have nothing else to do . "	2.024298436375943
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ?	1.956854085641599
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	2.240293940361378
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	2.155981780821448
put them next to your great uncle the judge .	1.7316155807280262
" oh !	0.7215098688949719
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "	1.6169356968509068
" yes , she did . "	1.346293167126326
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception .	3.073502269643577
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the tieof her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshie so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	1.9809456032551576
i was ready to die of laughter .	2.436397540368422
" perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "	2.1598017450899953
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never faie coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	2.256977426721758
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffiece , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	1.789094476073197
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislieof her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s sie the acquaintance would now be renewed .	2.1563376964666108
what a stroke was this for poor jane !	1.7958198543181942
" this account then is what he has receie from mr darcy .	2.0997318055429806
only look at her .	1.4537604876750247
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was liey and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .	2.188254739824199
one seems so forlorn without them . "	1.3306337441015206
" it is only eviet that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ . "	2.524829886237916
" your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "	1.7949943686257903
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza . "	2.265527027566957
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	1.9395679597882869
philips . - the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	1.762264686954135
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catheriede bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "	2.290513878791674
elizabeth immediately began playing again .	1.3581118101044516
for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . "	2.4383727945600366
" for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . - what advantage can it be to you to offend mr	1.7850969385993174
this was not very consoling to mr bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	2.5942015770271656
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some tie in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	1.8464617418320977
" when i consie , " she added , in a yet more agitated voie " that _i_ might have prevented it ! - _i_ who knew what he was .	2.055239239188541
letters of busies too !	1.2481465318071936
but as no such delicacy restraie her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even requiejane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	2.3481797015601478
" mr collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherieand her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spieof her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceie woman . "	2.1542553373323017
she has been allowed to dispose of her tiein the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	2.005903223109757
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just lieyour formality and discretion .	1.7608012979572163
mr hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joie their party in the drawing room .	2.2129463551691386
i have suspected it some tie but i am now convinced . "	2.434843582089564
hang kitty !	0.7480460376999938
my brother admie her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart .	2.113244449423683
it was mr collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceie that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	2.1224408712254386
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . "	2.004696116690624
it mortifies me .	1.4284979384548653
chapter ii	1.1163468009164315
" you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherieafter a short siece .	1.7737550607722887
" i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . "	2.49261508741948
" i adviemr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mr bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .	2.2207339626696156
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	1.9095447859458985
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed .	2.352803292811658
" your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desieof being well married ; and if i were determie to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .	2.131488597171932
mr wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	2.149820112142373
" if he does not come to me , _then_ , " said she , " i shall giehim up for ever . "	2.5083571170119727
we now come to the point .	2.0512714273167294
though lydia ' s short letter to mr f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b intending to trace their route .	1.9509936099943506
heaven and earth ! - of what are you thinking ?	1.9415022318202675
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance .	2.3414295988015046
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister .	2.0635790852193026
" certainly not ; at first .	1.8092089950785413
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiet happens to be so far off .	1.9313979940525987
she was receie , however , very poliey by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than polieess ; there was good humour and kindness . - mr	2.0619260240309685
" i deserve neither such praienor such censure , " cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things . "	2.2156158957556573
what has she to do with it ?	2.4139536888930015
the happies anticipated by catherieand lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , lieelizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	2.0505018124602508
i am happier even than jane ; she only smie , i laugh .	2.1076495505488912
" your first position is false .	1.2695347046899974
i wish i could see her .	2.5479196866836125
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	2.1229462234891616
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .	2.087018086116064
by jane this attention was receie with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not liethem ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration .	2.1933285739644903
" project gutenberg " is a registered trademark .	2.2608414639570316
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceie again .	2.3211341167777984
i have heard you mention them with consieation these twenty years at least . "	2.0235609603805624
mr bennet had very often wished , before this period of his lie that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wie if she survie him .	2.0982771674116507
but these things happen so often !	1.5114900519925114
_he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish . "	1.633545683779222
i have the greatest disliein the world to that sort of thing . - young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in lie	2.21110119992326
" good gracious !	1.0648378200842914
" wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .	2.072065679167983
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .	1.5154762364387382
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "	2.3082868095892892
that is the place to get husbands .	2.2775433133596716
balls will be absolutely prohibie , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	1.9530429115788552
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party . - " i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherie " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do .	2.250317740791253
i am only ashamed of his asking so little . "	2.257191451799848
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excieand to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admie ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catheriede bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her - their opinion of every body - would always coincie there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	2.1781795235032684
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .	2.3106674336271036
the first week of their return was soon gone .	1.7435166553519243
where , where is my uncle ? "	1.5516912303139145
the party did not supply much conversation .	1.7480717079479753
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .	2.3612285309222663
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happies .	1.980696780530967
it is what every body says .	2.335360549696371
oh !	0.7215098688949719
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .	2.3448638137172173
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more lieherself .	2.1199982304337643
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	2.294679811573988
you ought certainly to forgiethem as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "	1.8638748241866032
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confiece one cannot wonder .	2.010906616985951
she shall hear my opinion . "	1.8299676120153716
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	2.5056132388258123
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	1.7889315794869367
" this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he .	2.1565513578488185
how can mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	2.1256882227908527
" i did not know that you intended to walk , " said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	2.6111390263958354
and poor mr darcy !	1.7906598323076732
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "	2.091000257534215
" no , " said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	2.1144042995246988
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	1.9989818053831263

he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his liey concern for the welfare of his friend .	2.262391251474235
it was not without an effort meanwhiethat she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr darcy ' s proposals .	2.2215926082733928

and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . "	2.0923673559125424
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . "	2.095515628854926

it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "	2.573584746504042
lord bless me !	0.9405848268689505
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	2.063768228069521
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	1.6141325149840424
" lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "	2.4070098196741796
he should be particularly happy at any tie & c . & c . ; and if she would giehim leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	2.1471808975297755
" i can much more easily believe mr bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony . - if it be not so , let mr darcy contradict it .	2.1297257085901413
she could think only of her letter .	2.9340283269521827
whiein their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	2.059111683309981

he had not been long seated before he complieted mr bennet on having so fiea family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due tiewell disposed of in marriage .	2.1031878896589618
elizabeth hoped she had sieced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprie to see darcy in town last month .	2.131405668222524
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have tiefor speech .	1.7385600132213415
mr gardie looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .	2.1607130911173758
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "	1.9723398084429002
" i admiethe activity of your benevolence , " observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guie by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is requie . "	2.0504865665463763
darcy made no answer .	1.3533691746568761
" and that , " said mr reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master - and very liehim .	2.119285925107884

" oh , lord !	1.0254815448281533

the gentlemen arrie early ; and , before mr bennet had tieto tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .	1.9456644019071547
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the rie , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	2.079212357207095
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	2.246189334937055
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "	1.9220440705466777
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you .	2.4196967625063617
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceie in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	2.4202978373613018
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "	1.79871497473055
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherie have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s delieation , " i am not . "	2.2035848995523435

her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	2.0713154983689535
" we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherieand lydia . - elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	2.1340929317369555
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?	2.34943214361793
on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to gieus a ball at meryton ? "	2.3125738566547147
elizabeth was delighted .	1.7975401363346388

it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the - shie might be able to giemore information ; and , though she was not very sanguiein expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	2.3555274630309513
on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she receie them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	1.8966629246870002
but vanity , not love , has been my folly . - pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and drie reason away , where either were concerned .	2.01804721535125
" no more have i , " said mr bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "	3.290332787233013
" certainly , " he replied , biting his lips .	1.4133810833010318
the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	2.2645682818802304
" i do not believe mr long will do any such thing .	2.2915076803849392
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	1.937946772659802
mr bennet , to whose apartment they all repaie , after a few minutes conversation together , receie them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectie against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	1.9428851019241402

the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , receie some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself - from whom she had previously receie the information of his near concern in all his cousings affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	2.1728833257764277
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr collins too ! - why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? "	2.068393617165637
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevaie on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .	2.1868515583419765
it was eviet that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any ie of ; it was eviet that he was very much in love with her .	2.7550729835057988
you could scarcely escape discredit and miey .	1.8642514325879551
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again .	2.1329785245326427
brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiet of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton . "	1.7550378540774547
i dare say i shall soon see them here . "	2.2361495402808393
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarie , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	2.0564219151093273

be assured , my dear sir , that mr collins and myself sincerely sympathiewith you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no tiecan remove .	2.076597289385732
the park paling was still the boundary on one sie and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	2.0146082088637507
elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smie	1.9924424821570248
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joie by mr collins , but lieieby lady catherieand her daughter , to whom i have related the affair .	2.326845724403217
" i am sorry to hear _that_ ; but why did not you tell me so before ?	2.363265307729661
mr bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promieas to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an offie above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war offie another regiet should be quartered in meryton .	1.9375712063124053
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determie to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detaie first by the civility of mr collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .	2.005660515988058

such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly .	1.6211211035177664
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to giea flat denial , and rieoff as fast as i could . "	2.341157231810552
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in tie and the plan became perfect as plan could be .	1.837439284438018
a small sum could not do all this . "	1.8026426063685062
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quiegood enough for _her_ , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield .	2.2862990597844424
bennet . "	0.7215098688949719
wretched , wretched , mistake ! "	0.937022708363797
they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smie " come , mr wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .	2.339567450606445
yet now i must believe you , " cried jane .	1.6765986757900697
was a question which elizabeth receie from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .	2.7907181542325796
no aunt , no offies , no news could be sought after ; - the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy .	1.6507868168459752
oh !	0.7215098688949719
if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motie which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them . - with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .	2.1411129203912678
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .	2.133580847498037
and what can _he_ have to say ? "	2.160153386969811
" yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .	1.392557434671336
said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid ; for though i _am_ the youngest , i am the tallest . "	2.5276123731499265
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair .	1.8006594256338337
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .	1.8504429399084372
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; mr darcy looked up .	2.2188944454195436
he , who had always inspie in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .	2.015006306046547
" how good it was in you , my dear mr bennet !	2.2538115119986166
good heaven !	1.077084996980776
i am perfectly satisfied .	2.456670034238781
but it was a hope shortly checked by other consieations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when requie to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiet so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham .	2.1006549874009344
" it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .	2.2822574203086043
mr collins then returned to elizabeth .	2.0980093875567625
not handsome enough to dance with !	1.4690189720857132
now be sincere ; did you admieme for my impertiece ? "	1.6519720285049793
is not this an agreeable surprie "	1.770136439803898
bingley was sure of being lie wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence .	1.8103258830087217
she dared not even mention that gentleman .	1.841484627223115
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and mr collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .	2.1035774331018064
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .	2.1110265721948878
" you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smie and are provoking me to it every moment . "	2.3450425343024444
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .	1.9969213887216142
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guie that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .	2.0954940705680705
it is highly improper .	1.9586856229919494
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " - and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?	2.1464369244523605
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy ' s looks and behaviour .	2.4829538197112453
it was gratifying to have inspie unconsciously so strong an affection .	1.781575748224214
lady catherierose also , and they turned back .	1.584046011299911
but now it was all too natural .	2.275723368126005
the dejection was almost uniesal .	1.4256050323978753
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .	2.068949968098465
having resolved to do it without loss of tie as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffiece to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the busies .	2.153406584408172
your ie of the ponies is delightful .	1.7911433862146948
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smie and his easy address , whiehe claie their relationship , would have delighted them all .	1.9569079263658735
" now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said mr bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wie	2.2426269515913426
when lady catherieand her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mr collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .	2.0689291380751005
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .	1.9455036233491219
" do you not think it would be a proper compliet to the place ? "	2.4979222953568065
chapter xii	1.142655777030386
not that i am afraid of _myself_ , but i dread other people ' s remarks . "	2.4490320544688458
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mie with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confiece subsisted between mr darcy and herself .	1.9813774195294873
" i did not think you would ; - and that being the case , i cannot consie your situation with much compassion . "	2.219676643759357
* * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .	1.8687666036809354
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .	1.6884519170457928
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn .	1.8158114211004082
what is your own opinion ? "	1.9547568703663936
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .	2.330881935022608
their reception from mr bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .	2.152786663810157
why does she not come in ? "	1.7445716767476336
but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so consieable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .	2.0424197198885135
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "	2.258915259869304
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again .	1.9705602214861007
all this was acknowledged to mr gardie ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : - " i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .	2.2246171942453774
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer .	2.406247861713041
" this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth .	1.9152112332055846
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .	2.1357247277195994
said she , as she looked in her face .	2.572853231740737
my watchfulness has been effectual ; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparatieinsignificance .	2.325384143636515
the discussion of mr collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .	2.1057819374308906
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .	2.177271312545124
as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the niet cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .	2.350742310126496
lydia , my love , ring the bell .	1.606714313240253
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said .	2.144089509646294
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was . "	2.090982828814353
my dear charlotte , - impossible ! "	2.053474020590795
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .	2.275750555715211
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr	2.0965805179887065
the day passed much as the day before had done .	2.49866786612291
but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards miss king .	1.8842686510644386
" a man in distressed circumstances has not tiefor all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .	1.7431848432003363
- " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever siet on this point .	2.0943141756940866
elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .	1.7641612712661359
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .	1.7411082141196186
promieme , therefore , to come to hunsford . "	1.6898000295475153
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .	2.014584021978112

i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlie_them_ .	2.0923916428754104
elizabeth receie her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .	2.1725199213888318
it was possible , and sometie she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions .	2.0210882113444915
they had long wished to see him .	2.136943511269164
jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to elizabeth .	1.926076651921836
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "	1.8818781481993683
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .	2.0784126193116896
sometie one offie , sometie another had been her favourie as their attentions raie them in her opinion .	1.6406243682868384
mr darcy has not authorie me to make his communication public .	2.132411579565759
when i went away , i am sure i had no more ie of being married till i came back again !	2.5866739267871393
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "	2.3225570569475797
you will not , i hope , consie me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliet of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .	1.981893911598924
they are wanted in the farm , mr bennet , are not they ? "	2.0859160980809803
i am very , very sorry .	2.5777478785012793
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "	1.926943222922006
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .	2.0377765869638873
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . "	2.280341268690438
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .	2.475668278479785
not that _i_ think charlotte so _very_ plain - but then she is our particular friend . "	1.9279223229290232
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had receie , must make _her_ feel the oblie .	2.0930315804460866
so much the better .	1.4323319993616612
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . - your ' s , & c . " e	2.0771042660976704
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ . "	1.8536365429084585
she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wieto the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .	2.05802104325917
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwiehave faie of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resie with them .	2.050189922113673
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .	2.2689166584045135
mr collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could gielittle fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .	1.9012320993041043
" perhaps we might be deceie . "	1.6007340933209835
jane listened with astonishment and concern ; - she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham . - the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remaie to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of acciet or mistake , whatever could not be otherwieexplaie .	2.2319235877344448
the church _ought_ to have been my profession - i was brought up for the church , and i should at this tiehave been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "	2.260478717462703
so much the man of fashion !	2.2753865348914637
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quieignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has receie ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man .	2.496954103136586
mr bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admie by the netherfield party .	2.3541325971249667
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unliey to be lady catherie and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertiet questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprie mr darcy , and mr darcy only , entered the room .	2.421956459024363
i quiedetest the man . "	1.7722492941879278
but do not deceieyourself into a belief that i will ever recede .	2.1237974919974003
it was more than civil ; it was really attentie and there was no necessity for such attention .	2.330090452832642
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his sieeven more .	1.9541326996602826
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelliece .	2.1003618443421086
you are a great deal too apt you know , to liepeople in general .	2.3066664854349574
this he consieed sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .	2.2702817522254723
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .	2.0168287934304874
" this is not to be borne .	2.141634256632704
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "	2.238474590190461
they contaie no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .	1.5914511385516596
jane was not deceie , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .	2.086196833407419
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do , when i tell you all . "	2.779124802204448
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "	2.0643045415482066
how was that possible ?	1.6155360316390222
' lady catherie ' said she , ' you have gie me a treasure . '	2.06302812310413
it is mr bingley i am sure .	2.672632156181538
her carriage remaie at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it .	2.2226557934104623
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !	2.3767173192274695
mr gardie added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday .	2.385744548644902
her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing whiemr and mr gardie were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .	2.130963665395795
and now here ' s mr bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?	2.0396409545011895
mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .	2.210958814289363
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confiece would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the lieiest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .	1.9856146329091853
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two .	2.1734846224367117
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .	2.1498495144021943
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .	3.1278494906576677
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn .	2.79685756543666
the first tieof my ever seeing him in hertfordshie you must know , was at a ball - and at this ball , what do you think he did ?	2.344955909921137
her favouriewalk , and where she frequently went whiethe others were calling on lady catherie was along the open grove which edged that sieof the park , where there was a niesheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catheries curiosity .	2.097433441509591
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .	2.6920062776594453
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mr jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .	1.795357635893263
" i do not believe that he will ever lieat netherfield any more . "	2.371096108439015
and will you gieyourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information .	2.070339249137048
respect , esteem , and confiece , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happies were overthrown .	1.7252875665398513
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .	2.3315214136898375
charlotte says , she hardly ever does .	1.4090580001672648
in spieof this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .	2.024788493826408
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object .	2.010281889053755
she wished to discredit it entiey , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false !	1.8836855398208647
mr bennet was privieed to whisper it to mr philips , and _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton .	2.296456097018663
chapter iv	1.142655777030386
i feel as if i had never done you justie or loved you as you deserve . "	2.4141413704292436
mr bennet , in equal siece , was enjoying the scene .	2.1141903865910088
yes . - do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley .	1.989579067659981
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .	1.8989785113466333
collins . "	0.7215098688949719
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every fieminutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .	2.1103887291099364
the path just admitted three .	1.2978559245328012
" if you were aware , " said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must ariefrom the public notieof lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arie from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "	2.0661406926746073
was it merely to rieto longbourn and be embarrassed ?	1.7303695708611295
" i do , i do liehim , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him .	2.4942756425342116
" in marrying your nephew , i should not consie myself as quitting that sphere .	2.247778212193803
whiesettling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the ie of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquieparticularly after her .	2.1053369087176437
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . "	3.0152772266789762
" did it , " said he , " did it _soon_ make you think better of me ?	2.4704975464900905
at night she opened her heart to jane .	2.0520597258059827
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr bingley will lieit lizzy . "	1.861474011093181
have you never happened to see her there ? "	2.286528158667974
those were your words .	1.235729010261402
" she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley .	2.0040976280058342
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determie not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .	2.292680751146153
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ; - their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . "	2.158968449284071
but i must wrieno more .	2.4525055870217924
elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ?	2.1583080783702915
cried jane .	1.314867184156588
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "	2.5613611877796942
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned .	2.369842477689251
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .	1.8073523638478446
[ illustration : morning drss .	0.9603978832045336
but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .	2.357009136347415
in anticipating the happies of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .	2.295424509620715
" i _have_ heard from authority , which i thought _as good_ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "	2.2579517807079306
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evietly and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .	1.9069081129644647
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it .	2.123167857054994
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .	1.8447432229507272
if i may so express it , he has a _right_ to be proud . "	2.339929358364101
" nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth .	2.0974888631659048
" that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask .	2.385940791661635
he repeated the question , with some surprieat her siece .	1.6580508367021507
i should infiniey prefer a book . "	2.3482935177514546
it is useless to talk of it . "	2.321820720353155
" her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as i told lady catheriemyself one day , has deprie the british court of its brightest ornament .	1.848305603312635
and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?	2.211597785234226
my brother and the gentlemen are to diewith the offies .	2.028510308355965
this part of his intelliece , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmiehad been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polieinquiries which he dietly afterwards approached to make . - attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham .	2.0278168513324757
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .	1.992274339118097
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more tiebefore he wrote .	1.6050606625964063
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .	2.1535425925912985
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct , i am sure .	1.9022302763413446
to send donations or determiethe status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> whiewe cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requieents , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicie donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate .	1.7724122764781642
_she_ blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .	1.6947908135359957
never in her liehad she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .	1.8028963628972818
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh .	2.325517069636417
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _do_ diet me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can . - but these , i suppose , are preciey what you are without . "	1.8330196552660436
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smie she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way . "	2.065715581625623
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again .	2.3785842387390828
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton .	2.24956495791093
mr darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .	2.2904791718748134
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joie in maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .	2.0874365213232076
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .	2.0215943130993805
how are you all ? "	1.4885396367666814
you know not what you are about . "	2.421829098634295
i was uncomfortable enough .	2.096563388425168
" can you deny that you have done it ? "	2.2714666864916366
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in tieregain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was liey to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .	1.8825566769270827
" i am no longer surprie at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women .	1.8521017834754456
i wish you had been there .	2.6104446480722263
perhaps i am not doing her justie	2.2641365387863868
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion .	1.8436284532179557
" the indiet boast ; - for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consie them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .	1.9675597682660984
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catheries carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room .	2.0988899299109613
mr bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces .	2.484742972826892
i can hardly wriefor laughing .	1.8744650417905766
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatiey speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a tie	2.0161253175919236
that he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .	2.3511639055355364
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .	2.8622354332373514
" i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " _i_ can hardly be just to him . "	2.1966451531391433
but of this answer lydia heard not a word .	1.8877863745283148
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked .	2.0689417403956165
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .	1.818225389691829
mr bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrie to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her sie might be as long as it could .	2.334313596207334
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival .	1.6323472759393591
i knew how it would be .	1.8679101199597985
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir .	1.9885413714112485
" there is nothing the matter with me .	2.207619844516746
" yes , and i had heard it before .	2.1420912949193265
" at once to insist upon having such a report uniesally contradicted . "	1.9837714323424194
to carolies assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit .	2.113204553001888
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of fieand twenty .	2.0909499234645303
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her .	2.16290188562609
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudie i had been encouraging .	2.056544406635172
mr darcy , you cannot deny the fact . "	2.3863838869736056
" i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly .	2.9389478475063737
is not it so , mr	2.0783305569072015
" yes , very well .	1.224565357712012
well , any friend of mr bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . "	2.0901418928567437
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .	2.1418998099704285
till this moment , i never knew myself . "	1.7222431673819625
how rejoie was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !	1.7558747038851696
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordaie , if i would present him to the living in question - of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to proviefor , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions .	2.2334203853149113
all that is requie of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the fiethousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your lie one hundred pounds per annum .	2.071977152715235
they battled it together for a long tie which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .	1.987424362071805
we had better go into the avenue . "	2.3189211720047807
" i believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied wickham ; " i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never lie her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .	2.423281838259153
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without briey and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .	2.024342982350531
the general prejudieagainst mr darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .	2.270193760523648
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her lie "	1.8457094473968696
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .	2.368593092572351
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quiea lad , which might agree with it , and was confiet at last , that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy .	2.12489354860264
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance .	2.302672305455601
women fancy admiration means more than it does . "	1.5215671188770687
the suspicions which had just arie of mr darcy and their niece , dieted their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .	2.209972083476615
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and lieality towards him .	2.4850528913473497
the happiest , wiet , most reasonable end ! "	1.5065870311528353
lydia ' s voiewas heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .	2.0145191857577376
wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was siet ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoiethat he is wieenough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right .	1.987723268643617
she had once or twiesuggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the ie ; and mr collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s disliewould vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .	2.420722184042793
" nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .	2.0404114181049415
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . - but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .	2.056308374808077
i dearly love a laugh . "	1.7524767659243101
" he lie to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam .	2.0150604682397772
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .	1.9424722842145443
certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .	1.6295025662151528
" what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ?	2.7820243800707165
in such an exiece my uncle ' s advieand assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness . "	2.1768392510058474
her aunt now called her to look at a picture .	2.0743996386990133
every thing being settled between _them_ , mr darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home .	2.1640664040413453
whiethese newly born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing .	1.5499237216433812
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admie and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to .	1.7766391548131881
on the very last day of the regiet ' s remaining in meryton , he die with others of the offies at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her tiehad passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .	2.307822492591933
i never meant to deceieyou , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .	1.9756919625297993
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mr bennet with great polieess and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .	2.2083553931396223
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in siece ; and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away .	2.1211431990988645
i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you . "	2.553426062582979
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .	1.979381058873477
" your ' s sincerely , & c . " miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .	2.055848009571691
dear me !	1.313348378392401
their fortune on both sie is splendid .	1.6941566506071255
" do you consie the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?	2.0484688092055108
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .	1.8334859694262247
" lizzy , " said her father , " i have gie him my consent .	2.07277374992887
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .	2.21597212013892
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolies interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .	2.040582089126466
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .	2.0626982376627216
" i do not get on at all .	2.505244016494643
had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do !	2.4776443648486266
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !	2.2438927825682353
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say .	2.352375423697661
they then went away .	1.7825015706515566
why any fear of detection ?	1.7248064509517826
