when i last saw her , she was not very promising .	2.396151919622498
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .	1.6725093073540238

sir william and lady lucas are determie to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .	1.0295235466050574
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifieto her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .	0.8711501795138541
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .	1.1165986566483703

mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diesion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way .	1.0373911893272045
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and rie to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty .	0.9809871235022812

the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .	1.0766199362544837
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voie to mr jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entiey engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper dietion before her eyes .	0.9310037892274022

mr collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catheries being rather displeased by her staying at home .	1.0123745367640147
oh !	0.7215098688949719
" yes , very different .	1.3329205428472113
how much you must have gone through ! "	1.869840192670925
but i suppose you had no opportunity .	2.370084323633843
the possibility of mr collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr collins !	1.0211289641726964
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "	1.6658386234452718
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fiefigure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tieof his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshiecould then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .	0.8927808669671016
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .	1.8425094487702616

" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , gie by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , - a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "	1.3394314878666784
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quieunprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smie at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his priehad revolted , in his offer to herself .	1.1922373770667738
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other sie allowed them to see him before they met .	1.0023145853908764
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .	0.924915145824494
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - " this walk is not wieenough for our party .	0.9211545320163002

and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together .	1.223685068468988
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and whiemr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress .	0.898398588587482
mr hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustieof her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .	0.8980116887002317
" i am talking of possibilities , charles . "	1.4181973798033898

elizabeth now began to revie	1.0875033754954
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast .	1.168903027813642
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .	1.4135413045569718
not that i mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things i know are all chance in this world .	0.9576971856514654

" she is a most charming young lady indeed .	1.7385683227874777
what news ?	1.5374644444087586
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entiey on her sister and mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .	1.1426593505555425

when at length they arose to take leave , mr bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any tie without the ceremony of a formal invitation .	1.296387200008673
with many compliets to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , - to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mr bennet , with more perseverance than polieess , protested he must be entiey mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaie , " good lord !	0.9375865187276299

" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .	2.3842569584189612

she shared in their attendance on mr bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .	1.4294883435750003
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her - that she was not enough recovered ; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .	1.5625795623059453
" i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley .	0.9296559014227531
i do not know who is good enough for him . "	2.316044079909816
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second tiewith ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wies offers of refreshment .	1.0808324825093878
he wiey resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an ie had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it .	0.8830885742063821

her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happies she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .	1.0628982911329363
they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lie .	1.0076686817052414

he had been some tiewith mr gardie , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the rie , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .	1.1947204467896015
after walking some tiein this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the rie for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .	0.9110752201889152
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .	1.0172453256880365
darcy was not of a disposition in which happies overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besie the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .	1.0868192493445346

she was not rendered formidable by siece ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritatiea tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherieto be exactly what he had represented .	1.1922953349989334

in spieof having been at st james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .	1.0573333866016823

it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .	0.8178039200404453
it was first broken by mr annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and mr gardie , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .	1.0159278769541942
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .	0.9582335380354057

mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .	1.1769200546247245
" yes ; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not giehis real opinion about it .	1.0576435240447302

" what does mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? "	1.0498529542783686
four nieces of mr jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accietally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .	0.942824253904857
" oh ! "	0.7215098688949719
they were of course all intending to be surprie ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of mr bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt .	1.4329220873705724
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .	1.269279095780848

it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receiea return .	1.255952827898565
" yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly .	0.9386456785818715

she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joie them , and good naturedly engaged mr collins ' s conversation to herself .	0.8213085203169257

when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admiehim ; but so we all were .	1.2794265588729463
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little lie her going , that he told her to wrieto him , and almost promie to answer her letter .	0.9249600376376523
" yes , in conjunction with his friend . "	0.8130888267980702
before elizabeth had tiefor any thing but a blush of surprie mr bennet instantly answered , " oh dear ! - yes - certainly . - i am sure lizzy will be very happy - i am sure she can have no objection . - come , kitty , i want you up stairs . "	1.1158566839938528
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .	1.0580001360099962
but we consieed it , we talked of it as impossible .	1.4925526520963044
he readily assured her of his secrecy - again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliets for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .	0.8450184653044193

charlotte the wieof mr collins , was a most humiliating picture ! - and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .	1.0135287407524494
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish .	1.3711598581437254

but his prie his abominable prie his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consieation of his attachment had for a moment excie .	1.1444591435898113

nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in - law .	0.9331841529815036

a most welcome negatiefollowed the last question - and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revie the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .	1.3182201295728821

elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the tiewas now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entiey despaie of , they must in all probability have gaie some news of them .	1.0535730167780335

she had even condescended to adviehim to marry as soon as he could , provie he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , - some shelves in the closets up stairs .	0.9504979454008637

the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same tiedreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !	1.0007808676095342

she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least liey to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .	1.3751817276128766

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance .	0.9213083719580765

but still he would be her husband . - without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happies , must be their pleasantest preservatiefrom want .	0.8345038531756

thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were dieted to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women .	1.0867493446303327
she had obtaie private intelliece that mr darcy did not wish for cards ; and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .	1.034195757619388
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was oblie to go the next day for a short tie	1.147357378636573

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .	0.9599400895460891

his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .	1.1217888659611515
elizabeth soon perceie that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most actiemagistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , siece their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .	0.9710174493755283
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "	1.103552734920471
that his two sisters and mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determiewhether the siet contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smie of the ladies , were more intolerable .	1.3063546006063704

she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .	1.4248253007866798

" i am not now to learn , " replied mr collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometie the refusal is repeated a second or even a third tie	1.107269578115764

but to be candid without ostentation or design - to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad - belongs to you alone .	1.049355407710617
had not my own feelings decie against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consieation would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happies of a most beloved sister ? "	1.219774877932576
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mr bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mr bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to driehappies away .	1.2252779677610004
his sisters were fiewomen , with an air of decie fashion .	1.157188767905516
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .	1.211326594923849

" he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "	2.078501599043883
she asked her at different tie , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were liey to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maie name ? - elizabeth felt all the impertiece of her questions , but answered them very composedly . - lady catheriethen observed , " your father ' s estate is entaie on mr collins , i think .	1.005724964563177

" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago .	1.4332289928403463

have not you always hated him ? "	1.2495259619465293
thought elizabeth .	1.1834871455427567
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie . "	1.0036917495426159
" your ' s , & c . " this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she consieed that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .	1.002250355406468
" they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them . "	1.368248760036803
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .	1.0293971116599454
to mr gardie , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .	1.1350408528069675
" _i_ never saw such a woman .	1.2424145747728759
" you forget that i have made no answer .	1.9706407785845856
she had ventured only one glance at darcy .	1.140588329455844
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .	1.4934194908124845
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtaie my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all . "	1.1986296383563357
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : - and to have mr collins instead !	1.1251960329150914
whiesir william was with them , mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the tiebetween breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road .	1.0064915545373498
" this fieaccount of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quieconsistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "	0.9340713999766336
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .	1.3686317212925923
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquie by trade .	1.0901681656778985
jane was so admie , nothing could be lieit .	1.256473814627483
" i know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder .	1.9332275917337263
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentiey ; and i could then perceiethat his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him .	1.0536328942908262
after a short siece , the lady first spoke .	1.2518068844099839
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "	0.9955187904126263

they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .	0.8229040403194346

you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .	0.8312543304171673
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "	1.49312328760585
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .	1.1134092249476117
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself .	1.3698933645469247
she could not yet recover from the surprieof what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercie	1.2710038089087423
very little was said by either ; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .	0.9357489216506797
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "	1.055278999558607
cried elizabeth , " i am excessiey dieted .	2.2362617554188677
i told my sister philips so the other day .	1.1497720556339197
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again . "	1.295876256300924
her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; - but darcy , at whom it was all aie , was still inflexibly studious .	0.8723594634575386
the distance is nothing , when one has a motie only three mie .	0.8572981858853966
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherieand her mansion , with occasional digressions in praieof his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joie them ; and he found in mr philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .	1.092370806547027
it would have suie me in every respect . "	1.9987530119814534
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must gieyou pain , but it was necessary .	1.6270000380896574
she has known him only a fortnight .	1.1618888711349755
people do not die of little trifling colds .	0.7852824327894281
the gardies staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the offies , there was not a day without its engagement .	1.5466282995809433
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence .	1.0274961865321302
elizabeth , on her sie had much to do .	1.2765812503952265
jane shook her head .	0.9782611800816666
" which do you mean ? "	1.01835883272207
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .	1.465666656174338
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some acciet been lost .	0.9678428651184932
when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joie by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .	1.041202025344458
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely tieto express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .	1.310871324381115
when elizabeth had rejoie over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiet .	1.1978696392102253
i never saw such a long chin in my lie	1.4240730527306935
miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .	1.4028881492033234
said she .	1.3659879426287522
" i _did_ hear , too , that there was a tie when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the busies had been compromie accordingly . "	1.2272198417271734
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislieof mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them .	1.2213929051385939
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham .	1.027521042304565
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .	1.0924537896390565
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drieby my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "	1.0048239506217627
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia .	1.005035796419057
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its wrie were at tie wiey different .	0.8920554212855671
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .	1.6075770501415776
two obstacles of the fiebeing thus removed , mr bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catheriefor a consieable tie without making any impression on them .	0.7884448703694323
" my object _then_ , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgieess , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .	1.0641248910388443
" you must not blame my aunt .	1.6132039064730381
the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .	1.2675300493783794
i am not equal to it .	2.768398642331011
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little besieexpressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .	0.941023689453725
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a dietion of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wie	0.8917928575904256
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it .	1.3926591101651564
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four tie how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessiey they dislie being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislie	1.046601784124031
the surprieof such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .	1.191259285601837
" i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .	1.2028239669816134
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invie to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declie it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short tieshe could stay below with a book .	0.9438099637318215
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wiey in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .	1.0179152269958975

" perfectly so - i thank you . "	0.8036698733437422
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy .	2.0685360638560777
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .	1.0256032724913842
i remember the tiewhen i lie a red coat myself very well - and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with fieor six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regietals . "	1.020936888166441
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceiepeople as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?	1.4193389821534255
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .	1.0054062735591305
but as it is - you must not let your fancy run away with you .	1.7754502683937825
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long .	1.2474197502442743
" no , indeed , i did not . - i knew nothing at all of lady catheries connections .	2.1542431796111154
" i believe she did - and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "	1.487562500701904
if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .	1.146239860509184
mr gardie gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different tie between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , gie up the acquaintance .	1.0455509743019684
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to diet his search , which was more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .	1.1184696869105657

" do not gieway to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .	1.1841727320465913
what he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer .

" if you were to gieme forty such men , i never could be so happy as you .	1.412712569558704
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia .	1.0579330965787326

elizabeth immediately recognising the liey , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .	0.7739503407857959
the ie soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliet on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ .	0.9293153379862
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion requie .	0.9451118220396991

elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .	1.8379870467832249

but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it gieyou consolation to consie that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the liecensure , is praieno less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . - i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection . - he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . - the part which i acted , is now to be explaie . - his sisters ' uneasies had been equally excie with my own ; our coinciece of feeling was soon discovered ; and , aliesensible that no tiewas to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him dietly in london . - we accordingly went - and there i readily engaged in the offieof pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choie - i descrie , and enforced them earnestly . - but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference .	0.9443797224095829

as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she consieed it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .	1.0310338872712408

my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "	1.1429158212636201

when she thought of her mother indeed , her confiece gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr darcy , whose prie she was convinced , would receiea deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quiedecie at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of prie and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister .	1.1852207705010815

elizabeth receie them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remaie at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home .	1.3557189435652635
mr collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his liehaving been spent under the guidance of an illieate and miely father ; and though he belonged to one of the uniesities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .	1.2536743692528363
again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .	1.2533680842516892

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .	1.0045586221786504
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .	1.102680669125463

at length however mr bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no lieihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .	1.293014322258572
her niece was , therefore , oblie to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposiesieof the rie , in the nearest dietion ; but their progress was slow , for mr gardie , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .	0.9299583614168746

bingley intended it lieie and sometie made choieof his county ; but as he was now provie with a good house and the liety of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easies of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .	0.9942166737890914

did you see it ? "	2.4696891781858397
oh , brother , how kind you are !	0.8148303125426096
my feelings in every respect forbid it .	1.2782361767706885
as a brother , a landlord , a master , she consieed how many people ' s happies were in his guardianship ! - how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! - how much of good or evil must be done by him !	1.026736200591094
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her ' s lasted a little longer ; and in spieof her youth and her manners , she retaie all the claims to reputation which her marriage had gie her .	1.0571481284909487
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquieof elizabeth after the health of her family .	1.1197398103460443
his sister was less delicate , and dieted her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressiesmie	1.2846043513983747
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .	1.2432350876384
i cannot understand it .	2.315281954941369
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .	0.9661823261746143

her character will be fie , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determie flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .	1.1141618828641489
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the sieof the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a fie reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to diet her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .	1.046419592446785
whiethe contents of the first letter remaie on her mind , she was all surprie all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .	0.8902467143104462
i know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched up busies , at the expence of your father and uncles .	1.4534031250374824
" mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself ? "	2.466117008716582
however little mr darcy might have lie such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceie no other alteration than her being rather tanned , - no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .	0.8326519611541827
" this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desie - splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .	0.8240413380609493

" and have you heard from him often ? "	1.1050048973403281
there was no arguing upon such a project .	1.2352234819349739

" no governess !	1.188511014455816
the gardies staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .	1.1768947433567822
" perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister .	1.314835849817911
what a contrast between him and his friend !	2.0877535671327765
after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me .	1.2861833887795455
darcy . - _i_ talked about the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the sieof the room , or the number of couples . "	0.8094054146254462
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his lie every body had been most kind and attentieto him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceiean angel more beautiful .	1.0854256250547587
two days after mr bennet ' s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liety of coming to ask . "	1.2730080711701093
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remaie to be said , for the present .	1.7529069538140465
" i believe , ma ' am , i may safely promieyou _never_ to dance with him . "	1.1795631506818856
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sie room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally liey ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .	0.927307048995081
when dinner was over , she returned dietly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .	1.8515410914410695
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or consieing what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in sieand importance .	0.8538773491915634
she was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed . "	1.273851109072146
but how little of permanent happies could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .	0.8448064333692598
" well , well , and so mr bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mr philips first brought her the news . )	0.9710301062771072
this is the estimation in which you hold me !	1.6421974960840362
miss lucas is married and settled .	1.2352667188516342
but mr bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .	0.9808377848632895
elizabeth , who had a letter to wrie went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes .	1.4032950806559301
i will go dietly to mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure . "	1.9163351142687906
" elizabeth , you are not serious now . "	2.3763533571431883
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will gieyou satisfaction .	0.9644588966907186

" my dearest sister , now _be_ be serious .	1.0773128337172804
the possibility of meeting mr darcy , whieviewing the place , instantly occurred .	1.088839268491118
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which mr gardie had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .	1.1957995961157435
but in spieof all this fietalking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not gie him credit for _another interest_ in the affair .	1.0445209491196437

she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .	0.9139151144334572
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , whiethe servants remaie .	1.1186946424685258
your tempers are by no means unlie	0.9927912283867926
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .	0.855735818212996
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintaie herself by letting lodgings .	0.8415768351672619
" oh !	0.7215098688949719
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .	1.3935027644199685
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . "	1.7702337003292108
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notieof either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the tiewhen they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley .	1.0877884905402895
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "	1.0823094036997187
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examiethe meaning of every sentence .	1.1278987951426938
" it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "	1.5024714034126028
it was only said , ' lately , george wickham , esq .	1.2960846757780902

you gieme fresh lieand vigour .	1.1776869157149104
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr collins , and he was very soon oblie to take her ladyship ' s praieinto his own hands .	1.1592168139809373
they now walked on in siece ; each of them deep in thought .	1.5270051141406862
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the siece of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .	1.3145271027394367
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .	1.4040097963514309

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positieas to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertiece with the most forbearing courtesy .	1.0491848332892788
one came from her books , and the other from her toiete .	0.9023720899902633

" oh !	0.7215098688949719
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshie of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertaie in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherieherself , as well as of mr darcy .	0.9802545943560658
darcy had walked away to another part of the room .	1.2795326632683923
mr gardie then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complieted her on bearing it so well .	0.9027417116058694
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would lieto read it . "	1.3045217479189188
" i am sure _i_ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a fie , larger picture of him than this .	1.072734876423906
well , much good may it do them !	0.8185985446512265
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he dislie her , was still more strange .	1.2788517361772587
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her .	1.0305375683031723
the offies will find women better worth their notie	0.9004358805482656
and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receiea more favourable answer than you have now gie me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "	1.048370705017407
though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiets known to you . "	1.1620648926875985
his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .	1.0249757509447588
i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at civility , i am thus rejected .	1.0495552823093992
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the fiet fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smiefrom mr annesley to miss darcy had been gie , to remind her of her post .	0.9964315613592712
" i hope , my dear , " said mr bennet to his wie as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "	1.518232102647629
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every ie of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her lie	1.0145050115331593
" his prie " said miss lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .	1.1128504294919541

why must their marriage be private ?	1.018665656563316
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia .	1.354040870823301

she had also asked him twieto dieat rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .	0.9680418654457938
had his own happies , however , been the only sacrifie he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .	1.1448351703957418
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .	1.4996783517059622
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had lie him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .	1.591022182789782
elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .	1.0458118597824582
