elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of consieing the last half hour with some satisfaction , though whieit was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .	2.812361020180685

a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catheriede bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of prieand obsequiousness , self importance and humility .	2.5701481351987185
" let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "	13.455889876213744
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , whieshe added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "	2.6892834802603423
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and whieshe steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contaie in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any tieby their renewal .	2.5254542332070318

" it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometie a disadvantage to be so very guarded .	4.473472167929826
" has your governess left you ? "	1116.5883440136827
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshienews , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .	2.7410726348662764
" and can you lieiedeclare , that there is no _foundation_ for it ? "	51.69128398489946

my dear , " continued mr bennet , " i am quiedelighted with him .	40.80021394907914
" not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . "	4.976029156035582
it originated in mr gardie , who , fatigued by the exercieof the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s .	5.613127621398824
she blushed at the very ie ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .	4.976315350446708
they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea .	14.212517364540995
when is your turn to come ?	312.16116737301866
and what sort of table do they keep ?	81.39224793608774
she is almost three and twenty !	361.8635357975919
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .	3.103953588485213
" not that i _shall_ though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "	3.7434281146658854
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been consieed in hertfordshie	2.4379190605581074
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .	6.487055168605302
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voiewhich proved it to be mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate .	6.059155176116574

i shall tell colonel forster it will be quiea shame if he does not . "	14.802626501081347
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .	15.516001697180524

in a few minutes , mr bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . "	7.021596501981903
" had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? "	91.6471801339272
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invie her to follow her up stairs .	2.6873802904998305
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins ; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it .	6.796343787823624
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .	22.866838580880213
" you judge very properly , " said mr bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .	6.575210052624577
cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? "	128.48560247736327
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .	4.921776535102581
lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will giesuch pleasure to all my dear family !	11.808359038324646
miss bingley saw all this lieie and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the - shiemilitia removed from meryton ?	4.364279930949184
" with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "	10.761344648694106
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entaie . "	11.989429605786306
" about a month , " said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshie i understand . "	5.329723727620474
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .	7.6218516727795
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .	7.388585063067938
when that busies was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .	10.092717828528734
they will then join his regiet , unless they are first invie to longbourn ; and i understand from mr gardie , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south .	4.35442150688658
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determie not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .	5.012046812273348
you may imagiewhat i felt and how i acted .	58.911658262864925
but georgiana would not join her .	313.394137756682
when the ladies were separating for the toiete , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .	7.728094369914921
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you ; come into my room . "	17.067122570632844
" it is more than i engage for , i assure you . "	38.11186269080207
his words seemed to imply it .	436.571989526879
they were confie for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .	3.4977690595075788
by nature inoffensie friendly and obliging , his presentation at st james ' s had made him courteous .	13.51755147986662
" why , my dear , you must know , mr long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england ; that he came down on monday in a chaieand four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "	2.4463450129133113
" i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , - and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .	4.638971481188717
the strangeness of mr collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .	5.861390757207905
" he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .	70.55348598299832
" there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "	6.374404849674949
that lady i suppose is your mother . "	183.7064136173803
the happies which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .	3.6626225965421235
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news .	26.56726083835981
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .	15.39277441842694
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , - what could it mean ?	46.700824319013684
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it raie hard .	14.4399200827018
mr bennet could not have chosen better .	126.5662919736884
the promie letter of thanks from mr collins arrie on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted .	3.965098923617172
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invie this week .	15.821872605690539
" do you prefer reading to cards ? "	347.88496367020315
and she was only sixteen last june .	90.78858296864163
elizabeth had now but little tiefor conversation with her sister ; for whiehe was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself consieably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometie occur .	3.591475053268857
" to jane herself , " she exclaie , " there could be no possibility of objection .	20.951830588980368
i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper dietion . "	11.556033760455879
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "	7.550200835267039
i will wrieto my sister gardie about them dietly .	62.45782848816107
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mr bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .	4.534092813440887
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will giehim a good name .	10.511528486332514
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; mr darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . - elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him ; she really rejoie at it .	2.725905615947876
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .	6.557709156073842
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requie .	23.168818154614556

but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one tie "	8.435939471356258
" but if i do not take your lieess now , i may never have another opportunity . "	11.002951563815344
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quiecertain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . "	3.7684262495405147
the effect was immediate .	4895.148287722333
not that i care about it , though .	133.2649773268879
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happies , without reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "	4.7408544062282605
" no .	75895.0
in another minute mr bingley , but without seeming to have notie what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .	7.309766705908612
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .	3.6794439447805845
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .	6.796423280892934
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happies again , and promie their father another letter of thanks .	4.5841705117352705
" take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "	61.85601027354224
as they drove to mr gardie ' s door , jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .	3.5233852243688846
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mr	7.359973897358899
but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevaie on to go down without one of her sisters .	6.7228231128624945
mr gardie , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicatieess by his questions and remarks ; mr reynolds , either from prieor attachment , had evietly great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .	4.2286765070310235
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .	21.222741206495222
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admieher at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quiestruck with jane as she was going down the dance .	3.5072216201574866
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgiehim any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "	4.968949710904527
" indeed i do not dare . "	504.6888204817996
he was resolutely siet however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshie how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' _she_ a beauty ! - i should as soon call her mother a wit .

on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .	8.312147076020509
" we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either sie " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy .	6.672451602149116
elizabeth notie every sentence conveying the ie of uneasies , with an attention which it had hardly receie on the first perusal .	6.5100971544458535
your sister i also watched . - her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remaie convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she receie his attentions with pleasure , she did not inviethem by any participation of sentiet . - if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error .	2.6527710974742407
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated tie	4.065472253551134
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	7.399061663390119
" i am , dear sir , & c . & c . " mr gardie did not wrieagain , till he had receie an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	4.580854112085187
darcy shook his head in siet acquiesence .	187.1320342339681
nothing could gieeither bingley or myself more delight .	99.43596999162625
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	2.5117775694935496
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	3.94051172360816
you have a sweet room here , mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .	11.494176315504427
her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us .	57.85759746154122
his choieis disinterested at least , for he must know my father can gieher nothing .	18.271523163633724
had she not seen him in derbyshie she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	2.641123588752966
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not liey , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? - impossible .	2.7167591239626474
" you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .	31.17020524594797
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entiey , for she was a most determie talker ; but being lieieextremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prie , to have attention for any one in particular .	3.4019303823212477
if you should have no objection to receieme into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november <NUMBER> th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ' night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherieis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provie that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .	2.410512798141514
after walking several mie in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was tieto be at home .	4.711068405934893
they must all go to brighton .	332.21049226421246
and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ?	30.158864030588152
lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty !	19.556689955998056
her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at tie , have gie any thing to be privieed to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	3.4937848565889453
' ah !	75895.0
to catherieand lydia , neither the letter nor its wrie were in any degree interesting .	15.950959092760224
" compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .	8.458420050426497
it is not quiea week since they left brighton .	47.13975083467594
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiet , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourie . "	2.907359914678734
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !	98.518109829308
" it is a compliet which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . "	8.731504843688809
mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	4.676487854283614
" who do you mean , my dear ?	362.1897063769083
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper .	8.738328196338543
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !	50.517649783381984
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	4.794160421675491
mr gardie was surprie and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every ie gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	2.476864020292335
elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprie to find that he entertaie no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catheriede bourgh , by venturing to dance .	2.194585431775866
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	4.852242794566422
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confie and unvarying society . "	18.09585330921593
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .	10.497012501293293
lady catherielistened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual delieation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance .	2.8264122903561013
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , receie some assistance from her desieof getting rid of elizabeth .	4.259076939930774
" i have been used to consie poetry as the _food_ of love , " said darcy .	13.513106845964911
in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably diegaged tone .	2.990156208186796
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - delieated on the probability of each statement - but with little success .	6.051903007676564
mr bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	2.907485610872173
lord !	75895.0
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is liey to be in this country much longer . "	6.282570176246172
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley .	9.174749630357573
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	7.044509680477833
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshie and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happies , were within thirty mie of each other .	3.784629772518446
_they_ will never be distressed for money .	149.46106524037614
" _that_ is a failing indeed ! "	884.0635124786846
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every ie was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaie , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .	3.50653889770761
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	7.582997509229752
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "	5.046925361785148
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polierequest that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as poliey and more earnestly negatie , she seated herself .	5.262022577121558
had his character been known , this could not have happened .	34.87823479714077
in revolving lady catheries expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasies as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	4.808499729070755
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mr bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them tieto see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	2.9667280725028458
they are my old friends .	1057.9322051152299
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admie every remarkable spot and point of view .	8.341643806865534
within doors there was lady catherie books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lie in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	3.0065722745437546
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !	354.12690830828893
after sitting long enough to admieevery article of furniture in the room , from the sieoard to the fender , to giean account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr collins invie them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	3.268909149728445
" and will you promieme , never to enter into such an engagement ? "	28.51625620520181
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherie " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practiea great deal . "	3.987187001729549
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .	17.171002539754014
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with .	2.7523021735522475
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	3.4543014643021666
i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	5.651719107257177
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	5.202093952118741
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	50.07227049422369
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been gie up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	3.660300546864789

as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	7.459702027735041
she was more alieto the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	3.9210508501701438
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some tie allowed her at last to go - saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quieat leisure . "	3.1609521953152537
" how could i ever think her lieher nephew ? "	97.24835452301822
mr gardie had seen pemberley , and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well .	14.25245263052345
he could not help seeing that you were about fietie as pretty as every other woman in the room .	6.91603599555582
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - or i may say , three very silly sisters .	4.244370425925283
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .	5.751769871584647
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr and mr gardie were half a quarter of a miebehind .	6.39252841563908
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . - i know it cannot be long . "	11.86179256384442
but in spieof the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consie it entiey hopeless .	2.8446918969902706
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !	53.761509115877814
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	4.246334196314576
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	150.77292221700432
oh , no . "	75895.0
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?	22.192314020747123
miss darcy ' s praieoccupied the chief of it .	147.99812510905932
he readily agreed to it .	1116.9742366558917
her astonishment at his coming - at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshie	4.382501080526817
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this tieof year . "	16.7100791579108

unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "	10.215121957503039
such a countenance , such manners !	1095.443882046344
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was delieately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one sieof the paddock .	4.098064721387262
the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermie whether most to be pleased that he explaie himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious .	3.279950913554741
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - and perhaps you would not express it quieso strongly anywhere else . - here you are in your own family . "	4.970130936144479

" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshie my dear cousin .	10.883515598668588
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	3.1589101481393422
" not one . "	75895.0
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mr wickham frequently invie her to come and stay with her , with the promieof balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	3.1841813457903547
" how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "	36.54841348836916
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favouriechild , should be distressing him by her choie should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in miey till mr darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smie	2.130099095487346

" to yield readily - easily - to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you . "	15.151514736108686
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshiemay abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprieyou . "	3.988836288349246
sir william , how can you tell such a story ? - do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? "	7.179269527785703
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	3.240476703987295
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character . - oh !	35.77863238394376
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she receie an invitation from mr forster , the wieof the colonel of the regiet , to accompany her to brighton .	4.613043135102353
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mr bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh !	3.0025590793831047
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwiein her thoughts at the tie than as she hoped that , by carolies not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	2.98445091444853
" i should lieto know how he behaves among strangers . "	71.77816590596186
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	12.16886031035208
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , fieand twenty years ago .	6.3818376931305645

he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaiethat brought them from epsom .	4.923679559830701
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to gie and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !	6.316538106021487
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .	298.1689778237079
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .	6.89559626533472
" yes , there can ; for mieis totally different . - will you hear it ? "	34.352294833919906
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .	30.392785523071502
it cannot be concealed from any one .	132.17790282509168
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .	11.030996384648374
" there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to gieme no hope from law .	11.192761194823474
how much sooner one tie of any thing than of a book ! - when i have a house of my own , i shall be mieable if i have not an excellent library . "	4.46264232625036
on mr and mr gardie ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declie , and they parted on each siewith the utmost polieess .	3.634419047687243
" no , indeed .	75895.0
do not imagie miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	27.43176122184635
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "	37.02303813645129
he bore it however with admirable calmness .	152.75185618040595
had they fie on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislie make it so delightfully absurd !	5.059506566592971
" what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? "	99.36446416757462
my situation in lie my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consieation that in spieof your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	2.9470812777131035

she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	17.992439675080192
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .	7.224962997991871
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mr hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest .	2.837623420997681
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "	9.846999805158738
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .	23.61654866325225
there was no want of discourse .	215.18633188882671
wickham . - wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourieof my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . - but from the severity of that blame which was last night so lieally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motie has been read . - if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensieto your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry . - the necessity must be obeyed - and farther apology would be absurd . - i had not been long in hertfordshie before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . - but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . - i had often seen him in love before . - at that ball , whiei had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accietal information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had gie rieto a general expectation of their marriage .	1.7029277370242655
he then said , " i have receie a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	14.614381099275276

her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .	95.98424359506497
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mr philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he consieed the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	2.6070383579057994
there was also a postscript to this effect .	82.87116405258315
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	59.25608868583954
mr bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liety of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mr collins well . "	4.16905280434713
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .	5.526763018260322
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . "	16.36715941652738
console lady catherieas well as you can .	174.3072498377323
the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	12.323393516900246
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a tieexclaie , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourieof his father ! "	6.602625372725436
" in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .	15.022913761711145
mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding .	12.297937477522783
at present we have nothing to guieus .	231.56724326624752
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .	8.08843929757518
- you provie in accordance with paragraph <NUMBER> . f3 , a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy , if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <NUMBER> days of receipt of the work .	3.133926781234881
" how can you contrieto wrieso even ? "	302.2130587606617
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy .	23.015307178032362
she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprie the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town dietly , and of their meaning to diethat day in grosvenor street , where mr hurst had a house .	3.7641567576821964
" yes , sir , i know i am .	396.57299661726074
but their removing from the chaieinto an hackney coach is such a presumption !	20.20097837087146
its completion depended on others .	1077.7375248322658
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waie , is not it ?	8.76870955158737
lady catheries unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	12.729562237566013
" i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .	26.36710765202952
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	5.178055183293133
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	49.199727457658085
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? "	38.856080193898144
mr bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressiein her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advie which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happies of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	2.8006889645574176
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother .	23.330735041229495
it is a truth uniesally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wie	4.714331950657106
said he , as he joie her .	335.16996748422036
jane looked at her doubtingly .	2120.7842160543078
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .	4.414251390499583
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy , it determie her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .	3.025643389285347
" exceed their income !	75894.99999999996
elizabeth was surprie , but agreed to it immediately .	83.66204997042577
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prie by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .	5.861723081419275
no . "	75895.0
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .	12.001106498095549
we will go round the park every day .	89.61739855175236
" a little sea bathing would set me up for ever . "	44.646936113145706
mr collins was also in the same state of angry prie	18.714423052140987
on their being joie by mr bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .	2.742271259563464
" what is it you mean ? "	1048.17889672022
" you shall have it in few words .	166.23720143723608
this ie lasted whiea turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .	7.201641933090364
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .	77.34905683195853
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .	16.02384711952371
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself .	6.304684893885705
mr darcy may hug himself . "	1515.2277263211463
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happies where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoie in his domestic comforts .	4.0096670186271774
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed !	149.51609051186335
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he lie with her . "	5.590348675416813
the express was sent off dietly .	330.8026010800372
" he is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , liey ; and i never saw such happy manners ! - so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "	3.9645881009576107
he heard her attentiey , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "	3.491424326008957
she attracted him more than he lie - and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself .	7.593196511702258
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to giepleasure were prepossessed in her favour .	2.6708897959303797
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once .	14.998425471715677
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visie ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppiewood which bordered it .	2.936482036831684
she had gaie her point , and had tieto consie of it .	32.78346635941579
importance may sometie be purchased too dearly .	155.92975397190133
mr philips was quieawed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the - shie	2.8789541714593843
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .	9.533526308862575
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favouriedaughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .	4.093888065069971
" i wish i might take this for a compliet ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful . "	6.818453280183709
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .	15.914087904621026
do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without promietly displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph <NUMBER> . e1 with actielinks or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg tm liese .	2.4819553665102037
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happies in having obtaie the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explaie that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherie he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .	1.9700310591842476
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .	10.428368853004311
this is not the sort of happies which a man would in general wish to owe to his wie but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will deriebenefit from such as are gie .	4.016315602367849
i saw them the night before last . "	178.59918381293073
whiethus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy , by the feelings which prevaie on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .	2.8365856340054076
" oh !	75895.0
the others then joie her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in siece .	4.285883309751864
she related the subject of the pictures , the diesions of the rooms , and the prieof the furniture , in vain .	9.813556794896726
chapter iii	75895.0
he was receie by mr bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious polieess of her curtsey and address to his friend .	4.278137088393904
" i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second tie	13.397743996329954
" i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .	8.42295782934084
mr reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s lietie	15.45888303399635
" but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "	5.079174546408278
" it must have been his sister ' s doing .	79.70354067197636
not one party , or scheme , or any thing .	96.2603347954397
" but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "	6.605014113815866
" this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "	9.192248137853278
" i should be sorry indeed , if it were .	75.04238940636502
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fie with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .	3.1309154566236232
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .	91.51781520134132
your mother insists upon your accepting it .	166.7749516667268
he does not want abilities .	639.1711061862261
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever .	28.37333134831504
" yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have consieed her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "	3.6178546075660964
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitie .	5.244972053569278
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quienorthward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long .	5.87794130875845
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislieof the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fie on .	3.111947635610854
let me hear what it is . "	414.75122692121676
do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "	55.69810068277645
is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "	68.27791339248382
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .	7.739974687525173
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .	20.7485903468187
she went on .	75894.99999999996
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .	2.477375963524257
chapter i elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .	3.430901013723279
your ' s , & c . " mr darcy ' s letter to lady catherie was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what mr bennet sent to mr collins , in reply to his last .	4.312335018488765
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking busies , he was quick in its execution .	9.978930453475899
" that is to say , you had gie your permission .	57.92167803475232
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .	5.983396504596648
there is nothing else to be done .	141.75601915583525
she saw with the creatieeye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with offies .	13.102819410431097
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousings praie but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derie this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as liey to marry _her_ , had she been his relation .	2.596778091210879
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . "	3.6377465367817243
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions .	12.516419754057893
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . "	6.885100328584156
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherie and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were requie .	6.401912197353414
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagie till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a tiewhen the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the ie .	2.9476601944642487
what did colonel forster say ?	1080.3851955234684
" i do not at all know ; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield .	7.017811544482087
" it was a subject which they could not mention before me . "	22.132158256099604
every body said how well she looked ; and mr bingley thought her quiebeautiful , and danced with her twie	9.556682146922585
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choie had fortune permitted it .	5.317397299806112
you know my sentiets . "	3995.557319160341
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy - that mr darcy might leave the country , but that _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoie the netherfield ball the very next week .	3.813832551061821
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	23.14682375476912
when this information was gie , and they had all taken their seats , mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admie and he was so much struck with the sieand furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mr philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catheries drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliet , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room .	1.960017770915629
it was unpardonable .	75894.99999999996
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .	5.366266878894102
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .	44.70284327144342
" what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "	61.327159891388106
but that is one great difference between us .	94.39459989686189
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quiedistracted .	7.052320643380796
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .	7.355755790454398
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . "	18.67038587274077
another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and gieas much trouble as i can , - or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away . "	4.063164532142593
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happies ; and thirdly - which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advieand recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness .	2.850925221338071
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spieof a great opposition of character . - bingley was endeared to darcy by the easies , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	3.01341266671573
bingley . - but - good lord !	4956.103172999525
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	4.246334196314576
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	150.77292221700432
oh , no . "	75895.0
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?	22.192314020747123
miss darcy ' s praieoccupied the chief of it .	147.99812510905932
he readily agreed to it .	1116.9742366558917
her astonishment at his coming - at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshie	4.382501080526817
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this tieof year . "	16.7100791579108
chapter ii	75895.0
unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "	10.215121957503039
such a countenance , such manners !	1095.443882046344
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was delieately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one sieof the paddock .	4.098064721387262
the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermie whether most to be pleased that he explaie himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious .	3.279950913554741
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - and perhaps you would not express it quieso strongly anywhere else . - here you are in your own family . "	4.970130936144479

at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted - " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smie on each other .	4.862410628153473
" can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? "	42.367339605001874
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .	3.841589877638301
poor jane !	75895.0
how acutely did she now feel it .	170.12988542265356
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can descrie and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the siece and respect which her rank will ieitably excie	3.826671157558474
mr bennet had been strongly inclie to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetieand prieof one who had ten thousand a year .	2.5603704015765514
" and i have another favour to ask .	112.6572522159111
" yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing .	116.7900554071223
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy .	21.85020907840927
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? "	77.59745442128637
unfeeling , selfish girl !	75894.99999999996
you take delight in vexing me .	422.9232516817991
but in what proportions it should be divie amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .	8.655866886845182
she is gone down to her uncle at liepool ; gone to stay .	27.520760318176336
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .	26.864030297357985
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to presieat his table , nor was mr hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consie his house as her home when it suie her .	2.8186885626726927
certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "	21.186851552568594
by tea tiehowever the dose had been enough , and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to inviehim to read aloud to the ladies .	3.397157377955133

and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .	4.371872332004974
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .	19.516138071891056
put them next to your great uncle the judge .	61.54358549971711
" oh !	75895.0
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "	28.00989562956535
" yes , she did . "	75894.99999999996
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception .	12.944210480171403
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the tieof her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshie so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .	2.776925965020683
i was ready to die of laughter .	136.5423588458091
" perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "	5.400958016733905
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never faie coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .	2.8662765787955395
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffiece , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .	6.788502732386716
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislieof her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s sie the acquaintance would now be renewed .	2.794159124001634
what a stroke was this for poor jane !	100.25927620112766
" this account then is what he has receie from mr darcy .	31.70921965150832
only look at her .	5428.645205657054
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was liey and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .	3.465401450864244
one seems so forlorn without them . "	408.36336113010407
" it is only eviet that miss bingley does not mean he _should_ . "	18.825829232823946
" your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "	65.99186986789934
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza . "	9.688820194013287
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .	12.908056536868806
philips . - the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .	16.226606365207346
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catheriede bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "	6.592777461150362
elizabeth immediately began playing again .	1014.1741244028653
for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . "	7.145772087526159
" for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . - what advantage can it be to you to offend mr	10.864861854255187
this was not very consoling to mr bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .	4.579542083202468
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some tie in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .	5.070921339451611
" when i consie , " she added , in a yet more agitated voie " that _i_ might have prevented it ! - _i_ who knew what he was .	6.485880150166527
letters of busies too !	5422.810212196032
but as no such delicacy restraie her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even requiejane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .	3.084963259178742
" mr collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherieand her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spieof her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceie woman . "	3.527524961750142
she has been allowed to dispose of her tiein the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .	5.430097290680449
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just lieyour formality and discretion .	20.68944742384062
mr hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joie their party in the drawing room .	4.268821732717133
i have suspected it some tie but i am now convinced . "	25.375716913302526
hang kitty !	75895.0
my brother admie her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart .	3.0252835306601114
it was mr collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceie that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .	4.368463976581745
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him . "	6.017217516959854
it mortifies me .	75894.99999999996
chapter ii	75895.0
" you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherieafter a short siece .	19.643893281071758
" i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . "	2.7573594535934323
" i adviemr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mr bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning .	12.347182852266116
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .	7.741058944242852
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed .	2.996453643821594
" your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desieof being well married ; and if i were determie to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it .	3.628912184167935
mr wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .	4.176946803574141
" if he does not come to me , _then_ , " said she , " i shall giehim up for ever . "	12.681184045274792
we now come to the point .	327.18683593858395
though lydia ' s short letter to mr f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b intending to trace their route .	2.662128954777529
heaven and earth ! - of what are you thinking ?	79.22148486611131
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance .	4.74879089371406
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister .	21.431816688015825
" certainly not ; at first .	5026.671663198601
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiet happens to be so far off .	5.886324976464723
she was receie , however , very poliey by them ; and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than polieess ; there was good humour and kindness . - mr	5.15977392192973
" i deserve neither such praienor such censure , " cried elizabeth ; " i am _not_ a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things . "	6.268117096975014
what has she to do with it ?	191.9679582814367
the happies anticipated by catherieand lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , lieelizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .	3.2524527787156927
i am happier even than jane ; she only smie , i laugh .	32.883969784698564
" your first position is false .	1058.385562537678
i wish i could see her .	341.8979916057931
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home .	7.843155642679491
it will save me a world of trouble and economy .	39.817373223161624
by jane this attention was receie with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not liethem ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration .	2.813426614211495
" project gutenberg " is a registered trademark .	463.4252217422114
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceie again .	3.426488790187803
i have heard you mention them with consieation these twenty years at least . "	19.7264684904933
mr bennet had very often wished , before this period of his lie that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wie if she survie him .	3.465615182464858
but these things happen so often !	366.3123611020527
_he_ shall be mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish . "	48.58023904314605
i have the greatest disliein the world to that sort of thing . - young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in lie	5.324202549433962
" good gracious !	75895.0
" wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .	15.589703088245855
all connection between us seemed now dissolved .	187.646862449639
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "	10.267919807125358
that is the place to get husbands .	121.45980605881208
balls will be absolutely prohibie , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .	14.645958712196114
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party . - " i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherie " i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do .	4.37483288575373
i am only ashamed of his asking so little . "	49.1861760344195
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excieand to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admie ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catheriede bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her - their opinion of every body - would always coincie there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .	2.161635502240672
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham .	6.253070592260172
the first week of their return was soon gone .	55.55474968070012
where , where is my uncle ? "	1064.900447467866
the party did not supply much conversation .	148.98583712278162
he did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country .	4.905545505270717
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happies .	20.06108186384361
it is what every body says .	313.6384907478596
oh !	75895.0
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .	15.383538859868956
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more lieherself .	5.665832925386849
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .	28.5200523388476
you ought certainly to forgiethem as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "	5.863526734447156
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confiece one cannot wonder .	7.278509473824658
she shall hear my opinion . "	1101.280101037716
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .	9.963071506260578
you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .	24.698461977724925
" this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he .	12.718633990643367
how can mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?	5.823984741072367
" i did not know that you intended to walk , " said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .	6.842937521317886
and poor mr darcy !	5422.803311589814
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "	22.481856545333745
" no , " said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .	8.777403661567462
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !	4.6346911185805055
change of scene might be of servie and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . "	7.9350230310792

he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his liey concern for the welfare of his friend .	3.280916584428504
it was not without an effort meanwhiethat she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr darcy ' s proposals .	4.995289746716374

and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false . "	5.750646140664364
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . "	8.179923843997237

it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "	12.565577172149482
lord bless me !	75894.99999999996
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .	4.5892677783935465
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .	81.22029389149411
" lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "	4.966547833089386
he should be particularly happy at any tie & c . & c . ; and if she would giehim leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .	5.778184438083996
" i can much more easily believe mr bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony . - if it be not so , let mr darcy contradict it .	3.2140164628665433
she could think only of her letter .	174.29002092780746
whiein their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family !	2.954309185583826
a house in town !	4704.335099668737
he had not been long seated before he complieted mr bennet on having so fiea family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due tiewell disposed of in marriage .	2.684238625178245
elizabeth hoped she had sieced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprie to see darcy in town last month .	8.208934061694967
away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have tiefor speech .	19.048858795525156
mr gardie looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .	4.549089347040772
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "	6.872635024669772
" i admiethe activity of your benevolence , " observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guie by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is requie . "	4.15436377425256
darcy made no answer .	4123.033708302153
" and that , " said mr reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master - and very liehim .	9.557843119530073

" oh , lord !	75895.0
accept my thanks for the compliet you are paying me .	35.71323755910959
he shook his head . - " i wish i could call her amiable .	28.660871985898833
you are so strange !	4636.083015290027

the gentlemen arrie early ; and , before mr bennet had tieto tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out .	3.52142445872478
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the rie , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .	3.6467606628186187
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .	4.351073544873083
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "	4.5918449860232275
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could _feel_ gratitude , i would now thank you .	10.132341592491835
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceie in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .	5.762230037098034
why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "	11.18517133914349
though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherie have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s delieation , " i am not . "	4.5126079006273105
chapter ii	75895.0
i shall now know how to act .	155.5962641435864
wont it , kitty ? "	75894.99999999996
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .	6.532824924204313
" we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherieand lydia . - elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .	6.086446906057931
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?	7.053188763138205
on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to gieus a ball at meryton ? "	2.9968613415845278
elizabeth was delighted .	75894.99999999996
but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .	10.518054922153867
here comes hill .	75894.99999999996
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the - shie might be able to giemore information ; and , though she was not very sanguiein expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .	4.7722425719587145
on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she receie them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .	4.0116939705291115
but vanity , not love , has been my folly . - pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and drie reason away , where either were concerned .	3.3004053317110427
" no more have i , " said mr bennet ; " and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "	6.72364184749593
" certainly , " he replied , biting his lips .	406.6768565286925
the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .	3.7127854733935988
" i do not believe mr long will do any such thing .	26.064107396290208
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .	6.466599250589889
mr bennet , to whose apartment they all repaie , after a few minutes conversation together , receie them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectie against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .	2.691461562490707
jane will be quiean old maid soon , i declare .	65.53306837656326
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , receie some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself - from whom she had previously receie the information of his near concern in all his cousings affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .	2.69486548711343
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of mr collins too ! - why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? "	3.511070345547047

there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarie , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .	4.276506279711652

the park paling was still the boundary on one sie and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .	7.1582289199194
elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smie	10.548085451234671

the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his sie of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desieof never meeting again .	3.460902127505086

your sister i also watched . - her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remaie convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she receie his attentions with pleasure , she did not inviethem by any participation of sentiet . - if _you_ have not been mistaken here , _i_ must have been in an error .	2.6527710974742407
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated tie	4.065472253551134
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .	7.399061663390119
" i am , dear sir , & c . & c . " mr gardie did not wrieagain , till he had receie an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .	4.580854112085187
darcy shook his head in siet acquiesence .	187.1320342339681
nothing could gieeither bingley or myself more delight .	99.43596999162625
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .	2.5117775694935496
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on .	3.94051172360816

had she not seen him in derbyshie she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .	2.641123588752966
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not liey , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? - impossible .	2.7167591239626474
" you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound .	31.17020524594797
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entiey , for she was a most determie talker ; but being lieieextremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prie , to have attention for any one in particular .	3.4019303823212477

after walking several mie in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was tieto be at home .	4.711068405934893

her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at tie , have gie any thing to be privieed to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .	3.4937848565889453

every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiet , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourie . "	2.907359914678734
my dear , dear jane , i am so happy !	98.518109829308
" it is a compliet which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . "	8.731504843688809
mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .	4.676487854283614
" who do you mean , my dear ?	362.1897063769083
as a child i was taught what was _right_ , but i was not taught to correct my temper .	8.738328196338543
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss !	50.517649783381984
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .	4.794160421675491
mr gardie was surprie and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every ie gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .	2.476864020292335
elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprie to find that he entertaie no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catheriede bourgh , by venturing to dance .	2.194585431775866
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .	4.852242794566422
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confie and unvarying society . "	18.09585330921593
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .	10.497012501293293
lady catherielistened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual delieation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance .	2.8264122903561013
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , receie some assistance from her desieof getting rid of elizabeth .	4.259076939930774
" i have been used to consie poetry as the _food_ of love , " said darcy .	13.513106845964911
in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably diegaged tone .	2.990156208186796
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - delieated on the probability of each statement - but with little success .	6.051903007676564
mr bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months .	2.907485610872173
lord !	75895.0
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is liey to be in this country much longer . "	6.282570176246172
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley .	9.174749630357573
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .	7.044509680477833
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshie and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happies , were within thirty mie of each other .	3.784629772518446
_they_ will never be distressed for money .	149.46106524037614
" _that_ is a failing indeed ! "	884.0635124786846
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every ie was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaie , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you .	3.50653889770761
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .	7.582997509229752
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "	5.046925361785148
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polierequest that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as poliey and more earnestly negatie , she seated herself .	5.262022577121558
had his character been known , this could not have happened .	34.87823479714077
in revolving lady catheries expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasies as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .	4.808499729070755
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of mr bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them tieto see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .	2.9667280725028458
they are my old friends .	1057.9322051152299
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admie every remarkable spot and point of view .	8.341643806865534
within doors there was lady catherie books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lie in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .	3.0065722745437546
but the clothes , the wedding clothes !	354.12690830828893
after sitting long enough to admieevery article of furniture in the room , from the sieoard to the fender , to giean account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr collins invie them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .	3.268909149728445
" and will you promieme , never to enter into such an engagement ? "	28.51625620520181
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherie " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practiea great deal . "	3.987187001729549
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking .	17.171002539754014
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with .	2.7523021735522475
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .	3.4543014643021666
i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .	5.651719107257177
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .	5.202093952118741
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !	50.07227049422369
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been gie up to nothing but amusement and vanity .	3.660300546864789

as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .	7.459702027735041
she was more alieto the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place .	3.9210508501701438
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr collins ' s letter ; and after laughing at her some tie allowed her at last to go - saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quieat leisure . "	3.1609521953152537
" how could i ever think her lieher nephew ? "	97.24835452301822
mr gardie had seen pemberley , and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well .	14.25245263052345
he could not help seeing that you were about fietie as pretty as every other woman in the room .	6.91603599555582
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - or i may say , three very silly sisters .	4.244370425925283
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it .	5.751769871584647
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , mr and mr gardie were half a quarter of a miebehind .	6.39252841563908
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . - i know it cannot be long . "	11.86179256384442
but in spieof the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consie it entiey hopeless .	2.8446918969902706
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld !	53.761509115877814
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel .	4.246334196314576
no thanks to his gallantry for that .	150.77292221700432
oh , no . "	75895.0
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ?	22.192314020747123
miss darcy ' s praieoccupied the chief of it .	147.99812510905932
he readily agreed to it .	1116.9742366558917
her astonishment at his coming - at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshie	4.382501080526817

unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "	10.215121957503039
such a countenance , such manners !	1095.443882046344
upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was delieately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one sieof the paddock .	4.098064721387262
the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermie whether most to be pleased that he explaie himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " you look conscious .	3.279950913554741
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - and perhaps you would not express it quieso strongly anywhere else . - here you are in your own family . "	4.970130936144479

" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshie my dear cousin .	10.883515598668588
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .	3.1589101481393422
" not one . "	75895.0
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mr wickham frequently invie her to come and stay with her , with the promieof balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .	3.1841813457903547
" how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "	36.54841348836916
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , his favouriechild , should be distressing him by her choie should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in miey till mr darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smie	2.130099095487346

sir william , how can you tell such a story ? - do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? "	7.179269527785703
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .	3.240476703987295
" when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character . - oh !	35.77863238394376
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she receie an invitation from mr forster , the wieof the colonel of the regiet , to accompany her to brighton .	4.613043135102353
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on mr bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh !	3.0025590793831047
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwiein her thoughts at the tie than as she hoped that , by carolies not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .	2.98445091444853
" i should lieto know how he behaves among strangers . "	71.77816590596186
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .	12.16886031035208
their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , fieand twenty years ago .	6.3818376931305645

he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaiethat brought them from epsom .	4.923679559830701
" how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to gie and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it !	6.316538106021487
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring .	298.1689778237079

the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw .	30.392785523071502
it cannot be concealed from any one .	132.17790282509168

on mr and mr gardie ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declie , and they parted on each siewith the utmost polieess .	3.634419047687243
" no , indeed .	75895.0
do not imagie miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .	27.43176122184635
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "	37.02303813645129
he bore it however with admirable calmness .	152.75185618040595
had they fie on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ pointed dislie make it so delightfully absurd !	5.059506566592971
" what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? "	99.36446416757462
my situation in lie my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consieation that in spieof your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .	2.9470812777131035

she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .	17.992439675080192
she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham .	7.224962997991871
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mr hurst and miss bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the two eldest .	2.837623420997681
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "	9.846999805158738
but do not imagine that he is always here so often .	23.61654866325225
there was no want of discourse .	215.18633188882671
wickham . - wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourieof my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . - but from the severity of that blame which was last night so lieally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motie has been read . - if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensieto your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry . - the necessity must be obeyed - and farther apology would be absurd . - i had not been long in hertfordshie before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . - but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . - i had often seen him in love before . - at that ball , whiei had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accietal information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had gie rieto a general expectation of their marriage .	1.7029277370242655
he then said , " i have receie a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .	14.614381099275276
my aunt told me so herself on saturday .	102.99464027514472
dear , yes ; - but you must own she is very plain .	33.37382429351436
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming .	95.98424359506497
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when mr philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he consieed the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .	2.6070383579057994
there was also a postscript to this effect .	82.87116405258315
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .	59.25608868583954
mr bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " may i take the liety of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mr collins well . "	4.16905280434713

the day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .	12.323393516900246
elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a tieexclaie , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourieof his father ! "	6.602625372725436
" in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either .	15.022913761711145

she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprie the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town dietly , and of their meaning to diethat day in grosvenor street , where mr hurst had a house .	3.7641567576821964

well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waie , is not it ?	8.76870955158737
lady catheries unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .	12.729562237566013
" i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .	26.36710765202952
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .	5.178055183293133
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?	49.199727457658085
if _she_ does not object to it , why should _we_ ? "	38.856080193898144
mr bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressiein her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advie which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happies of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .	2.8006889645574176

" my dear madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receie and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . "	3.5965627251789876

jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffiece of affection sometie overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .	4.067747112132302

a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catheriede bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of prieand obsequiousness , self importance and humility .	2.5701481351987185
" let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "	13.455889876213744
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , whieshe added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "	2.6892834802603423
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and whieshe steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contaie in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any tieby their renewal .	2.5254542332070318

elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherie and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were requie .	6.401912197353414
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagie till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley , and _her_ being the sister of jane , was enough , at a tiewhen the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the ie .	2.9476601944642487

had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?	23.14682375476912
when this information was gie , and they had all taken their seats , mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admie and he was so much struck with the sieand furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when mr philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catheries drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliet , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room .	1.960017770915629

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spieof a great opposition of character . - bingley was endeared to darcy by the easies , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .	3.01341266671573
