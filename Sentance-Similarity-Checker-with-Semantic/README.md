<!-- Introduction -->
    This model is able to calculate or give a score signifing the sentence similarity score between 0 to 1.
    This model is also capable for Paraphrase Checker and Question Similarity Checker.



<!-- Requirements -->
    The below required libraries should be included:
        Open the jupiter Notebook with name "CL2_Project_SentenceSimilarity_FinalSubmission" inside the folder "Code".



<!-- How to use -->
    STEP 1. Open the jupiter Notebook with name "CL2_Project_SentenceSimilarity_FinalSubmission" inside the folder "Code".

    STEP 2. Run the Code Loading Libraries (if some error comes that some additional libraries are also required, just install them also from the error).

    STEP 3. Run the Code from Section 1 to Section 5

    STEP 4. Then just go to the last Section "Testing the model" and there the template for using the Sentance similarity score, Paraphrase Checking and Question Similairty checker are given with the Optimal respective DELTA and THRESHOLD value provided.

NOTE - Section 6 and 7 takes 3 HRS to run and they just calculate the same DELTA and THRESHOLD value calculated which is given in the last section "Testing the Program".
